**Objective:**

Based on the article content, create 3-4 challenging USMLE-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to assess comprehension. The MCQs should be suitable for inclusion at the end of the MDX file and formatted as specified.

---

**Instructions:**

1. **MCQ Placement:**

   - At the very end of the MDX article, include an `<MCQGroup>` component to contain the MCQs.

2. **Question Development:**

   - **Relevance:**
     - Design questions that are directly related to the key concepts and information presented in the article.
     - Ensure that each question tests important aspects of the topic to reinforce learning.
   - **Difficulty Level:**
     - Create challenging questions that reflect the style and depth of USMLE examinations.
     - Aim for a mix of recall, application, and analysis-level questions to assess different cognitive skills.
   - **Clinical Vignettes:**
     - Whenever appropriate, frame questions as clinical scenarios to mimic real-life applications.
     - Include necessary patient information such as age, gender, medical history, symptoms, and test results.
   - **Distractors:**
     - Provide plausible distractors (incorrect options) that reflect common misconceptions or closely related concepts.
     - Ensure that only one option is the correct answer.

3. **Feedback Provision:**

   - **Correct Feedback:**
     - Provide a detailed explanation for the correct answer.
     - Include reasoning that reinforces understanding and connects back to the article content.
   - **Incorrect Feedback:**
     - Offer helpful hints or guidance that directs the learner toward the correct answer without explicitly revealing it.
     - Address why the chosen incorrect option is not the best answer, clarifying common misunderstandings.

4. **Formatting Guidelines:**

   - Each question should be formatted as an object within the `<MCQGroup>` component, following the example below.
   - Use proper MDX syntax to ensure correct rendering on the Nextra documentation website.
   - **Important:** Your response must only include the ready-to-use MDX code block containing the `<MCQGroup>` component and nothing else. Do not include any introductory or explanatory text outside of the code block.
   - **Response Format:**
     - Begin your response directly with the code block.
     - Do not include greetings, explanations, or any text before or after the code block.

5. **Example Format:**

   ```mdx
   <MCQGroup questions={[
     {
       question: "A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with crushing chest pain. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4. She undergoes successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a drug-eluting stent placed in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). Two days later, she develops new-onset atrial fibrillation with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 4. Her medications include metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Which of the following antithrombotic regimens is most appropriate at discharge?",
       options: [
         "Aspirin 81 mg daily plus warfarin (INR target 2-3)",
         "Aspirin 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily",
         "Triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin for 6 months, then warfarin alone",
         "Aspirin 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus rivaroxaban 15 mg daily",
         "Apixaban 5 mg twice daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily"
       ],
       correctAnswer: 2,
       correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient requires triple therapy with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and anticoagulation due to recent PCI with stenting and new-onset atrial fibrillation with a high stroke risk. Triple therapy should be maintained for the minimum duration necessary (usually 6 months for drug-eluting stents) to reduce bleeding risk, after which anticoagulation alone can be continued.",
       incorrectFeedback: "Consider the need for both antiplatelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis and anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk from atrial fibrillation. What regimen balances these requirements while minimizing bleeding risk?"

   ]} />
   ```

6. **General Guidelines:**

   - **Language and Clarity:**
     - Write questions and explanations in clear, professional language suitable for medical students and professionals.
     - Avoid ambiguous wording that could confuse the reader.
   - **Medical Accuracy:**
     - Ensure all clinical information and explanations are accurate and up-to-date with current medical guidelines.
   - **Formatting Consistency:**
     - Maintain consistent formatting for all questions and options.
     - Use correct units, medical terminology, and abbreviations as appropriate.
