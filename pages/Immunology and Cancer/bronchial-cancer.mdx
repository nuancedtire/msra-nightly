# Overview of Lung Cancer

This article provides an in-depth exploration of lung cancer, focusing on types, staging, diagnosis, and management.

## Types of Lung Cancer

Lung cancer, which primarily affects the bronchi and bronchioles, can be categorized into two main types: **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)** and **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**.

### Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)

- **Characteristics:**
  - Classified as neuroendocrine tumors.
  - Predominantly linked to smoking, with other risks including radon and asbestos.
  - Typically arises near a main bronchus.
  - Displays aggressive behavior with rapid growth and spread.
  - Notoriously high recurrence rates.

### Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

- **Categories:**
  - **Adenocarcinoma:** Starts in mucus-producing cells.
  - **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Initiates in flat cells, commonly smoking-related.
  - **Large Cell Carcinoma**
  - **Bronchial Carcinoid**

Common metastatic sites for bronchial/lung cancer include:
- Liver
- Bone 
- Brain

## Staging of Lung Cancer

Lung cancer staging utilizes the TNM system, further divided into detailed stages:

### Stage 1

- **1A:** Tumor less than 3cm, no lymph node involvement (`T1a-c, N0, M0`)
- **1B:** Tumor between 3-4cm, no lymph node invasion (`T2a, N0, M0`)

### Stage 2

- **2A:** Tumor 4-5cm, no lymph node invasion (`T2b, N0, M0`)
- **2B:** Diverse criteria include tumor size up to 7cm and varying lymph node invasions.

### Stage 3

- **3A:** Includes central chest lymph node invasion and tumors up to 7cm that affect central structures.
- **3B:** Extensive lymph node involvement, sometimes with opposite-side or supraclavicular lymph nodes.
- **3C:** Large tumors and significant spread affecting multiple lung lobes or extensive local invasion.

### Stage 4

- **4A:** Cancer affects both lungs, pleural/pericardial spread, or isolated lymph nodes/organs like the liver.
- **4B:** Cancer has a widespread presence in distant organs.

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms

- Persistent cough, haemoptysis, shortness of breath, fatigue, unintended weight loss, pleuritic chest pain, and dysphagia.

### Signs

- Frequent chest infections, clubbing, wheezing, and a hoarse voice may indicate lung cancer.

**Complications:** Voice changes may stem from recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, and breathing issues may indicate phrenic nerve involvement.
</Callout>

### Paraneoplastic and Other Syndromes

#### Paraneoplastic Syndromes (Especially in SCLC)

- **Hormonal Effects:**
  - Elevated cortisol causing Cushing’s syndrome.
  - Increased ADH leading to hypertension and oedema.
  - High autoantibodies linked with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.
  - Increased parathyroid hormone reducing bone calcium.

#### Carcinoid Syndrome

- Symptoms from bronchial carcinoma include diarrhea, flushing, wheezing, palpitations, telangiectasia, and abdominal pain.

*Pancoast syndrome* in upper lung cancers may cause Horner's syndrome with ptosis, pupil constriction, and anhidrosis.

## Investigations

- **Imaging:** Chest X-ray (coin lesions, lymphadenopathy), spiral CT, MRI for metastases.
- **Biopsy and Endoscopy:** Obtain tissue samples via bronchoscopy.
- **Cytology:** Analyze sputum and thoracentesis fluid.

#### Carcinoid Syndrome Diagnosis

- Elevated 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in a 24-hour urine test may confirm diagnosis.

#### Screening

- Suggested annual low-dose CT scans for individuals aged 55-74 with significant smoking history or additional risk factors.

## Management

### Pharmacological Interventions

#### For NSCLC

- **EGFR Overexpression:** Treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
- **Chemotherapy:** Options include cisplatin combinations, sometimes with subsidiary drugs like irinotecan. Use radiotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy for unresolvable cases.
- **For Carcinoid Syndrome:** Administer octreotide.

#### For SCLC

- Chemotherapy alongside radiotherapy, particularly in limited cases or extensive diseases.
- Prophylactic cranial irradiation to lower brain metastasis risks.

### Non-Pharmacological Interventions

#### NSCLC

- **Surgery:** Preferred for resectable cancers within stages 1 to 3, barring those with insufficient lung function (`FEV1 >60%`).
- **Radiotherapy:** Applied when surgery isn’t viable.

*Smoking cessation is crucial for all patients.*

  {
    question: "A 60-year-old man with a 40-pack-year smoking history presents with a persistent cough and weight loss. A CT scan reveals a 5cm mass near the main bronchus with no lymph node involvement. Which type of lung cancer is most likely?",

    correctFeedback: "Correct! Squamous Cell Carcinoma is commonly linked to smoking and often presents as a central mass near main bronchi.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's strong smoking history and the tumor's location near the bronchus. Which type of lung cancer is most associated with these characteristics?"
