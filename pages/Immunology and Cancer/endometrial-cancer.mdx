# Endometrial Cancer: An Overview

Endometrial cancer, a malignancy of the uterine lining, ranks as the fifth most common cancer in women, following breast, lung, colon, and skin cancers. Approximately 90% of endometrial cancers are **adenocarcinomas**, categorized into type I (estrogen-dependent endometrioid carcinoma) and type II (estrogen-independent non-endometrioid carcinoma). Type I cancers arise from atypical hyperplastic endometrium and tend to have a better prognosis. In contrast, type II cancers, although less common, develop from an atrophic endometrium and transition into more aggressive forms, such as clear-cell carcinomas and serous adenocarcinomas.

## Diagnosis

Endometrial cancer typically affects women over 50, with a median diagnosis age of 63 years. In the UK, approximately 8,600 new cases are reported annually.

### Common Symptoms

- **Postmenopausal bleeding** 
- Menstrual cycle irregularities
  - Excessive bleeding
  - Intermenstrual bleeding
  - Vaginal discharge

*Note:* Bleeding is classified as postmenopausal after 12 months of menopause. Prompt medical consultation for postmenopausal bleeding often leads to rapid diagnosis, given its strong correlation with uterine cancer. However, premenopausal bleeding variations might not immediately suggest illness, leading to potential diagnostic delays.

### Symptoms of Advanced Stages

- Increased abdominal girth (*ascites or ovarian cysts*)
- Pain (*impact on adjacent organs*)
- Shortness of breath (*lung metastases*)
- Fatigue

### Risk Factors

- Extended periods of unopposed estrogen exposure 
- Menopause post-52 years
- Elevated BMI
- Nulliparity
- **Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)**: 30-60% lifetime risk
- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
- Diabetes
- Tamoxifen use

## Investigations

- **Gynecological examination**: Observation of blood or cancerous tissue might be visible.
- **Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)**: Assesses endometrial thickening.
- **Endometrial biopsy**: Often performed during an outpatient hysteroscopy.
- **Hysteroscopy**: Preferred for its high diagnostic accuracy.
- Measurement of **Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125)**
- **Computerized tomography (CT) scan**
- **Chest X-ray**
- **Full blood count (FBC) and liver function tests (LFTs)**
- **Pregnancy test** (for childbearing-age women)

**Important Note:** Staging is conducted perioperatively, guided by FIGO standards. Preoperative CT scans aid in staging and surgical planning.

### FIGO Staging

- **Stage I**: Carcinoma confined to corpus uteri
  - IA: Limited to endometrium or minor myometrial invasion
  - IB: Involvement of over half the myometrium
- **Stage II**: Cancer reaches cervical stroma, still uterus-bound
- **Stage III**: Spread beyond uterus 
  - IIIA: Serous or adnexal involvement, positive peritoneal cytology
  - IIIB: Parametrial or vaginal metastases
  - IIIC: Pelvic (IIIC1) or para-aortic lymph node metastases (IIIC2)
- **Stage IV**: Bowel, bladder, or distant metastases
  - IVA: Bowel mucosa or bladder invasion
  - IVB: Distant metastases

*Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages (FIGO III-IV).*

## Management

### Medical Management

Treatment strategies are contingent on FIGO staging; surgery is generally essential. For patients desiring fertility preservation, stage IA cancer may be managed with progestogens.

### Surgical Management

- **Stage I**: Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
- **Stage II**: Radical hysterectomy with systematic pelvic node dissection
- **Stages III-IV**: Combination of debulking surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy
  - If surgery is not feasible, external beam and intracavity radiotherapy are alternatives.
  - Some patients may require adjunctive radiotherapy; many are treated surgically.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 62-year-old postmenopausal woman presents with vaginal bleeding. She reports no other symptoms and has a BMI of 32. Her past medical history includes hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Which of the following risk factors is most strongly associated with the development of endometrial cancer in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Hypertension",
      "Body Mass Index (BMI)",
      "Postmenopausal status",
      "Diabetes mellitus"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Elevated BMI is a significant risk factor for endometrial cancer due to increased peripheral estrogen conversion in adipose tissues, leading to unopposed estrogen exposure.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the influence of hormonal factors and unopposed estrogen exposure. Which risk factor directly contributes to increased estrogen levels?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 55-year-old woman undergoes a hysteroscopy after presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. An endometrial biopsy confirms endometrioid carcinoma. The biopsy report states deep myometrial invasion but no metastasis to the cervix or beyond the uterus. How would this cancer be staged according to FIGO standards?",
    options: [
      "Stage IA",
      "Stage IB",
      "Stage II",
      "Stage IIIA"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Stage IB is characterized by involvement of more than half of the myometrium, consistent with this patient's findings.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the extent of myometrial invasion indicated in the report and relate it to FIGO staging criteria for endometrial cancer."
  },
  {
    question: "A 49-year-old woman is diagnosed with endometrial cancer stage IA and wishes to preserve her fertility. Which treatment option should be considered for managing her cancer?",
    options: [
      "Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy",
      "Progestogen therapy",
      "Radical hysterectomy",
      "External beam radiotherapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Progestogen therapy can be used to manage stage IA endometrial cancer in patients who wish to preserve fertility.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about conservative treatment modalities that might be preferred in a patient desiring fertility preservation for early-stage endometrial cancer."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a clinical suspicion of advanced endometrial cancer undergoes imaging for staging purposes. Which imaging studies are most appropriate to include preoperatively according to the article?",
    options: [
      "CT scan and chest X-ray",
      "MRI and bone scan",
      "PET scan and abdominal ultrasound",
      "Bone scan and echocardiogram"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A CT scan and chest X-ray are recommended for staging and surgical planning to assess for metastases and other spread.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the typical imaging modalities used to evaluate for metastatic spread in endometrial cancer preoperatively."
