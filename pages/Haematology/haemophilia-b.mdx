# Understanding Haemophilia B (Christmas Disease)

Haemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease, is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects males. It is characterized by a deficiency in coagulation factor IX, resulting in a bleeding tendency. This X-linked condition occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 male births and is typically less common and severe than haemophilia A.

## Diagnosis

The manifestation of haemophilia B often depends on the severity of factor IX deficiency:

- **Severe:** ``<1 IU/dL`` (``<0.01 IU/mL``) or ``<1%`` of normal
- **Moderate:** ``1-5 IU/dL`` (``0.01-0.05 IU/mL``) or ``1-5%`` of normal
- **Mild:** ``6-30 IU/dL`` (``0.06-0.30 IU/mL``) or ``6-30%`` of normal

**Symptoms** range from easy bruising in childhood and spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles, and soft tissues, to excessive bleeding following trauma or surgery. Severe cases often become evident in toddlers learning to walk, while milder forms may only become apparent after serious injury or surgery.

**Differential Diagnosis** should consider:

- Haemophilia A and C
- Von Willebrand's disease
- Vitamin K deficiency
- Anticoagulant effects
- Disorders in fibrinogen or fibrinolysis
- Platelet or vascular disorders

## Investigations

To diagnose haemophilia B, consider the following tests:

- **Full Blood Count (FBC):** Normal haemoglobin and haematocrit unless recent bleeding occurred.
- **Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT):** Typically prolonged.
- **Prothrombin Time (PT), Bleeding Time (BT), Fibrinogen, and Von Willebrand Factor:** Usually normal.
- **Factor IX Assay:** Reduced levels confirm the diagnosis.
- **Factor Inhibitors Levels:** Monitor periodically.
- **Imaging Studies (X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound):** Detect joint degeneration.
- **Cord Blood Testing:** Essential for confirming diagnosis in newborns from carrier mothers, using uncontaminated samples post-delivery.

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

In cases of major bleeding, prompt action is crucial. A full CT scan is effective for detecting haemorrhages. Immediate administration of recombinant factor IX is recommended to elevate factor IX activity to ``100%``. If unavailable, use monoclonal-antibody purified factor IX, fresh frozen plasma, or cryoprecipitate. Maintain increased factor IX activity for 7-10 days following a severe bleed.

## Management (Prescribing)

**Prophylaxis** with factor IX is advisable in severe haemophilia B, especially during childhood, to prevent future haemarthrosis. The regimen should be individualized based on patient needs and extend to at least physical maturity. For minor bleeding, conservative measures like pressure and elevation may suffice. If not, use recombinant factor IX as the primary treatment. Avoid NSAIDs and intramuscular injections due to their haemorrhagic risk. Prior to elective surgery, ensure factor IX activity reaches ``50-100%``. Genetic testing is advised for families and carrier mothers.

## Management (Non-prescribing)

Educate patients on haemophilia B, emphasizing the avoidance of high-risk activities like contact sports, while encouraging physical activity to maintain health.
