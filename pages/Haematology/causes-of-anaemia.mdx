# Understanding Anaemia: Classifications, Diagnosis, and Management

Anaemia is a condition characterized by insufficient red blood cells or haemoglobin, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. It is diagnosed with haemoglobin (Hb) levels `< 12g/dL` in females and `<13.5g/dL` in males. **Iron deficiency anaemia** is the most prevalent form of anaemia.

## Categories of Anaemia

Anaemia is classified into three main categories:

- **Microcytic**
- **Normocytic**
- **Macrocytic**

### Microcytic Anaemias

- **Iron Deficiency Anaemia:**
  - Causes include blood loss (e.g., heavy menstruation, gastrointestinal bleeding), inadequate iron intake, and poor iron absorption (e.g., coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), H. Pylori infection, gastrointestinal surgery, TMPRSS6 gene mutation).

- **Thalassemias:**
  - Includes alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia. Note that beta-thalassemia trait often presents with little anaemia but marked microcytosis.

- **Sideroblastic Anaemia:**
  - Characterized by iron accumulation in red blood cell mitochondria, hindering haemoglobin production.
  - Inherited types (e.g., X-linked recessive, ALAS2 gene), acquired (e.g., alcoholism, myelodysplastic syndrome, copper deficiency, vitamin B6 deficiency), or idiopathic.

- **Anaemia of Chronic Disease:**
  - Associated with autoimmune disorders and cancer.

### Macrocytic Anaemias

- **Megaloblastic Anaemia:**
  - Due to impaired DNA synthesis.
  - Causes include vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g., vegan diet, Crohn's disease, gastric bypass, pernicious anaemia) and folate deficiency (e.g., pregnancy, inadequate intake).

- **Non-Megaloblastic Anaemia:**
  - Characterized by macrocytic anaemia without impaired DNA synthesis.
  - Causes include chronic alcoholism, liver disease, hypothyroidism, certain medications (e.g., anti-retrovirals, hydroxyurea), and myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Normocytic Anaemia

- **Increased Red Blood Cell Loss/Breakdown:**
  - Causes include haemolysis (acquired through infections, autoimmune disorders, physical trauma, drugs) and hereditary conditions (e.g., G6PD deficiency, sickle cell anaemia, hereditary spherocytosis, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria).
  - Haemorrhage is also a contributing factor.

- **Decreased Red Blood Cell Production:**
  - Caused by chronic renal failure, erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency, bone marrow suppression (due to infection, drugs, malignancy), or anaemia of chronic disease.

- **Increased Plasma Volume:**
  - Occurs during pregnancy.

*Note:* Coeliac disease can lead to mixed deficiencies of folate (macrocytic) and iron (microcytic), resulting in a normocytic presentation.

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms

- **Anaemia:**
  - Shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness, pallor, palpitations.

- **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:**
  - Paraesthesia, ataxia, impaired vibration sense, positive Romberg’s test, pale skin, petechiae, glossitis, angular cheilitis, cognitive impairment, and common anaemia symptoms.

- **Folate Deficiency:**
  - Headaches, weight loss, and common anaemia symptoms.

- **Haemolytic Anaemia:**
  - Jaundice and potential splenomegaly (linked to hereditary spherocytosis or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), gallstones causing right upper quadrant pain, and dark urine in intravascular haemolysis (e.g., G6PD deficiency, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria).

### Investigations

- **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume):**
  - Microcytic anaemia: MCV `<80fL`
  - Normocytic anaemia: MCV `80-100fL`
  - Macrocytic anaemia: MCV `>100fL`

- **Microcytic Anaemia - Iron Studies:**
  - **Iron Deficiency Anaemia:** Low serum iron (`<10μmol/L`), low ferritin (`<10μg/L`), increased total iron-binding capacity (`>70μmol/L`), low transferrin saturation (`<16%`).
  - **Thalassemia:** Normal iron studies.
  - **Sideroblastic Anaemia:** Elevated serum iron, high ferritin, low total iron-binding capacity.
  - **Anaemia of Chronic Disease:** Low serum iron (`<10μmol/L`), high ferritin, low total iron-binding capacity (`<45μmol/L`), transferrin saturation `5-15%`.

<summary>Additional Normocytic and Macrocytic Anaemia Investigations</summary>

- **Normocytic Anaemia:**
  - Corrected reticulocyte count: Increased (>2%) in haemolysis/haemorrhage, decreased with reduced red blood cell production. Elevated creatinine indicates chronic kidney disease.

- **For Iron Deficiency Anaemia (Microcytic)**
  - Test for H. Pylori infection.
  - Consider faecal occult blood test and endoscopy/colonoscopy for suspected GI bleeding.
  - Coeliac serology to exclude coeliac disease.

Bone marrow biopsy and red blood cell staining diagnose sideroblastic anaemia by identifying ringed sideroblasts.

- **For Megaloblastic Anaemia (Macrocytic):**
  - Macrocytosis, hypersegmented neutrophils seen in blood smear.
  - Test for vitamin B12 and folate levels.
  - Plasma homocysteine elevated in B12 and folate deficiencies.
  - Increased plasma/serum methylmalonic acid in B12 deficiency; normal in folate deficiency.
  - Anti-Intrinsic Factor antibodies for pernicious anaemia.
  - Endoscopy for Crohn's disease suspicion.

- **For Non-Megaloblastic Anaemia (Macrocytic):**
  - Imaging for haemorrhage.
  - Haemolysis markers: increased LDH, decreased haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin, and increased reticulocytes.
  - Peripheral smear abnormalities based on haemolysis cause.
  - Coombs test positive in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.
  - Haemoglobin electrophoresis for sickle cell disease diagnosis.
  - **G6PD Deficiency:** Heinz bodies, bite cells on peripheral smear (G6PD levels not low during acute attacks).
  - **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria:** Flow cytometry shows >1-3% anchor-deficient granulocytes.

</details>

## Management

### Prescribing Interventions

- **Iron Deficiency Anaemia (Microcytic):**
  - Oral iron supplements (e.g., ferrous sulphate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, ferric maltol) alongside vitamin C. If not tolerated, consider ascorbic acid.
  - Intravenous (IV) iron for intolerance to oral iron.
  - Blood transfusion if necessary.

- **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:**

  **Asymptomatic/Mild Deficiency:**
  - Oral B12 supplements for vegans or patients over 65 with poor diet; consider lifelong cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin if no response.
  - Cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin for patients with chronic GI conditions or post-bariatric surgery.

  **Symptomatic Deficiency:**

  - Mild/Moderate symptoms require lifelong cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin.
  - Severe symptoms necessitate parenteral cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin, with referral to a neurologist/haematologist. Some cases may need blood transfusions and folic acid supplementation.

- **Folate Deficiency:**
  - Pregnant women and those at risk of deficiency should take folate supplements.

- **Normocytic Anaemia due to Chronic Renal Disease:**
  - Epoetin alfa, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, is utilized.

- **Sickle Cell Disease:**
  - Long-term hydroxycarbamide.

- **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria:**
  - Eculizumab and blood transfusions.

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

- **Iron Deficiency Anaemia (Microcytic):**
  - Treat underlying cause; blood transfusions as needed.

- **Anaemia of Chronic Disease and Non-Megaloblastic Anaemia:**
  - Address underlying conditions.

- **Sideroblastic Anaemia:**
  - Treat underlying cause, vitamin B6 therapy, and desferrioxamine to remove excess iron.

- **Non-Megaloblastic Macrocytic Anaemia due to Haemorrhage:**
  - Stop bleeding, administer IV fluids, and perform blood transfusions.

- **Haemolytic Anaemia:**
  - Treat underlying condition; consider splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis.

- **Sickle Cell Disease:**
  - Avoid triggers such as cold weather, sudden temperature changes, high altitude, or dehydration to prevent crises. Regular transfusions with iron chelation therapy might be necessary.

- **G6PD Deficiency:**
  - Avoid triggers (e.g., broad beans, certain drugs like primaquine, aspirin, dapsone, sulphonamides). Utilize blood transfusions and folic acid supplements. Severe cases may require splenectomy, with prior vaccinations and long-term antibiotics.
