# An Overview of Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)

**Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)**, also known as **Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura**, is an autoimmune hematological disorder. It is classified into two types: **Primary ITP**, where thromboycytopenia (`<100x10⁹/litre`) occurs without a discernible cause, and **Secondary ITP**, which involves isolated thrombocytopenia in conjunction with an identifiable condition or medication. The demographic often affected by ITP includes:

- Children under the age of 10
- Adults over 65
- Women of childbearing age

**Clinical Presentation:**  
ITP can manifest in various forms, from asymptomatic cases detected during routine testing to significant symptoms such as petechiae, minor bruising, or life-threatening hemorrhage.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing ITP involves a thorough exclusion of other potential causes, making a detailed history and examination crucial. Ultimately, a laboratory diagnosis confirms ITP by identifying isolated thrombocytopenia (`<100x10⁹/litre`). Key symptoms to watch for include:

- Petechiae
- Bruising
- Unexplained or easy bleeding
- Fatigue in some cases

**Risk Factors:**

- Secondary ITP-associated diseases
- Lymphoproliferative disorders
- HIV and Hepatitis C
- Autoimmune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Additional at-risk groups include:

- Children under 10 years
- Women of reproductive age
- Adults over 65
- Recent viral infections

## Investigations

The primary investigations include a **Full Blood Count (FBC)** and a peripheral blood smear. The FBC identifies isolated thrombocytopenia, while the peripheral smear helps differentiate true thrombocytopenia from pseudothrombocytopenia due to EDTA tubes. Additional tests may involve excluding secondary ITP causes, such as HIV or Hepatitis C screens, bone marrow biopsies, and sometimes thyroid function tests (TFTs), as ITP is linked with clinical hyperthyroidism in roughly 8–14% of cases.

ITP arises when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets, crucial for clotting. This reduction in platelets can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding. Understanding the autoantibodies involved is key in developing effective treatment strategies.

## Management

### Management (Prescribing)

**Conservative Management:**
- Suitable for asymptomatic or minor bleeding cases, especially in children, where mere observation suffices.
- In adults, management depends on severity and platelet counts, specifically distinguishing counts greater or less than `30x10⁹/litre`.

Treatment recommendations:

- For **severe bleeding or platelet counts under `30x10⁹/litre`**: Consider corticosteroids and/or Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG).
- For **counts above `30x10⁹/litre` without severe bleeding**: Observation is recommended.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

Management should consider disease severity and lab results. While approximately 80% of children experience spontaneous remission, older individuals face higher mortality rates and may not respond well to existing therapies. For mild or asymptomatic cases, observation remains the most prudent approach. Chronic cases often require specialized consultation for additional intervention.

**Warning:** Continuous monitoring of the patient's condition and regular assessment of platelet counts is critical during treatment.
