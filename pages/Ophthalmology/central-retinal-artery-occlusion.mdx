# Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a medical emergency due to the risk of permanent loss of vision without prompt treatment. CRAOs are most commonly caused by **atherosclerosis**, but it is essential to consider other causes, most notably **temporal arteritis** in patients over 50 years of age.

## **Diagnosis**

CRAOs cause **sudden painless monocular visual loss**. Examination findings are as follows:

- Relative afferent pupillary defect (`RAPD`).
- A pale retina with a central ‘**cherry-red spot**’ which represents sparing of the macular arterial supply from the choroid.
- Attenuation of retinal arteries and veins.
- Visible emboli.

**Branch retinal arteriolar occlusions (BRAOs)** are caused by emboli and result in altitudinal field defects.

## **Investigations**

1. **Blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipids:** 
   - Hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia are risk factors for atherosclerosis.
   
2. **Fluorescein angiogram:** 
   - Shows slow-filling retinal arterioles.
   
3. **OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography):** 
   - Useful in cases of delayed presentation which are harder to diagnose clinically.
   
4. **Carotid Doppler scan:** 
   - Carotid plaques or stenosis are the primary cause of CRAO.
   
5. **Other tests:** 
   - Clotting panel, thrombophilia screen, antiphospholipid screen, vasculitis screen, and temporal artery ultrasound may be indicated if a haematological or inflammatory cause is suspected.

## **Management (non-prescribing)**

**Prognosis is poor:** Visual acuity improves in only 1/3 of patients, with no treatments proven to markedly improve prognosis. In the acute setting, the following can be tried:

- IV **acetazolamide** +/- anterior chamber paracentesis to reduce intraocular pressure.
- Ocular massage to dislodge or disintegrate the thrombus/embolus.
- Ophthalmic artery catheterisation + thrombolysis.
- **Systemic steroids** may be indicated if an anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (`AION`) is suspected.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old man presents with sudden painless vision loss in his left eye. Examination reveals an afferent pupillary defect and a pale retina with a central cherry-red spot. His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Which of the following is the most likely underlying etiology for his condition?",
    options: [
      "Giant cell arteritis",
      "Central retinal vein occlusion",
      "Embolism due to carotid artery disease",
      "Optic neuritis",
      "Retinal detachment"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's presentation is consistent with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), and in older patients, embolism from carotid artery disease is one of the most common causes. The cherry-red spot and afferent pupillary defect further support this diagnosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While temporal arteritis could be a consideration in older patients, the hints provided in the vignette favor embolic disease. How might a history of vascular risk factors like hypertension and hyperlipidemia link to the visual findings?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following imaging studies would be most useful in evaluating a suspected cause of central retinal artery occlusion?",
    options: [
      "Fluorescein angiography",
      "CT scan of the head",
      "MRI of the brain",
      "Carotid Doppler ultrasound",
      "Fundus photography"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A carotid Doppler ultrasound is excellent for visualizing potential carotid plaques or stenosis, which are common causes of CRAO. Understanding the arterial supply's condition is critical in managing a patient with this condition.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the specific causes of CRAO and which investigations would best visualize them. Which test would help assess the blood flow in supplying arteries that are likely involved in this condition?"
  },
  {
    question: "In the acute management of a central retinal artery occlusion, which of the following interventions has shown the most promise in improving visual outcomes?",
    options: [
      "Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents",
      "Topical beta-blockers",
      "Ocular massage",
      "Systemic corticosteroids",
      "Sub-tenon’s injection of anesthetic"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Ocular massage can help to dislodge any potential embolus and can improve visual outcomes if performed shortly after onset. Although there is a lack of strong evidence for any treatment, certain approaches might be beneficial if done promptly.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the immediate options available in the acute setting for CRAO. Think about the rationale behind ocular massage and how it may help relieve the occlusion. What do you know about the urgency of this condition?"
