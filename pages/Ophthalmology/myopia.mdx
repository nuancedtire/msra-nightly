# Myopia (Short-Sightedness)

Myopia, or short-sightedness, is a condition where objects appear blurry when far away but can be seen clearly when near. It occurs due to the inability to focus light rays from a distance onto the fovea (a refractive error); instead, it is over-focused with the convergence point being in front of the fovea, resulting in a loss of clarity. 

There are two main ways this can happen:
- The lens refracts and bends the light beams too much.
- The eyeball becomes too long.

Once it starts to develop, generally there is no established method to stop or slow its progression; however, the natural course is that it tends to slow and plateau after **20 years of age**.

## Diagnosis

Myopia affects approximately **1/3 of adults**, with symptoms typically arising between **6 to 13 years**. It can also occur in adults. Clinical suspicion should arise if a child:

- Needs to sit in the front of the classroom to see the whiteboard clearly.
- Sits too close to the television.
- Rubs their eyes regularly.
- Complains of headaches or tired eyes.

If myopia is suspected, patients should be advised to book an appointment with the optician to get their eyesight tested formally.

## Investigations

The mainstay of investigation for myopia is still visual acuity testing. Many opticians have started substituting the traditional Snellen’s chart with electronic images that test various other parameters simultaneously, such as:

- Colour (affected in colour blindness or optic neuritis)
- Light dispersion (affected in astigmatism)

Formal testing includes reading a Snellen’s chart at a controlled distance. If blurriness is present, the use of corrective lenses can help determine the degree of error.

| Investigation Type          | Purpose                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Visual Acuity Testing       | Determine clarity of vision               |
| Snellen’s Chart             | Measure level of myopia                   |
| Corrective Lenses Assessment | Determine degree of refractive error      |

Left untreated, patients may develop a lazy eye (amblyopia) or a squint (strabismus). 

Patients need to be counselled regarding the increased risk of complications such as:
- **Open-angle glaucoma**
- **Cataracts**
- **Retinal detachment**

If any symptoms suggestive of these develop, patients will need to undergo further investigations.

## Management (Prescribing)

There are no prescribed medications indicated for the treatment of myopia.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

The three forms of treatment include:

1. **Glasses with corrective lenses**
2. **Contact lenses**
3. **Corrective surgery**

### Glasses

- **Cost-Effective**: The cheapest and safest option.
- **Lens Type**: Concave (minus) lenses are used to bend light rays slightly outwards to offset over-focusing.

### Contact Lenses

- **Functionality**: Similar to glasses but sit directly on the surface of the eye.
- **Cost**: More expensive and require more care, particularly regarding hygiene.
- **Potential Complications**: Includes keratitis and corneal ulcers if a contaminated lens is applied.

### Laser Eye Surgery

Can restore perfect eyesight or drastically improve the degree of refractive error; however, it is more costly and generally not available on the NHS. 

**Complications** may include:
- Hazy vision
- Night blindness
- Peripheral haloes

**Common procedures include**:
- **LASIK** (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis)
- **LASEK** (laser sub-epithelial keratomileusis)
- **PRK** (photo-refractive keratectomy)

**Contraindications**: These procedures are contraindicated in:
- Pregnancy
- Diabetes
- Immunocompromised patients

### Artificial Lens Implant

An even newer technique that involves inserting a corrective lens directly into the eyeball to improve focus, which is also not available on the NHS.

  {
    question: "A 10-year-old boy presents with difficulty seeing the whiteboard at school and often sits in the front row. Based on your clinical suspicion of myopia, which of the following is the first line investigation you would recommend?",
    options: [
      "Electrophysiological testing of the retina",
      "Visual acuity testing with a Snellen’s chart",
      "Ophthalmic examination under cycloplegia",
      "Optical coherence tomography",
      "Visual field testing"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Visual acuity testing using a Snellen’s chart is the standard first-line investigation for assessing myopia. This method allows for an accurate measurement of the patient's ability to see at various distances and helps confirm the diagnosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the initial steps for diagnosing visual problems in children. Which test would provide a clear indication of their vision without requiring more complex or invasive procedures?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 25-year-old woman is diagnosed with myopia during her routine eye exam. What percentage of adults does myopia typically affect in the general population?",
    options: [
      "Approximately 10%",
      "Approximately 20%",
      "Approximately 30%",
      "Approximately 33%",
      "Approximately 50%"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Myopia affects approximately 1/3 of adults, making it a common refractive error. Understanding the prevalence can help frame the impact of this condition in the general population.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the epidemiological data presented. What fraction of the adult population is affected by this common visual impairment, and how does that compare to other possibilities?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with untreated myopia develops amblyopia. What is the most likely cause of this complication?",
    options: [
      "Inadequate visual stimuli during critical periods of visual development",
      "Extraocular muscle imbalance",
      "Corneal scarring due to untreated keratitis",
      "Increased intraocular pressure leading to optic nerve damage",
      "Systemic conditions affecting vision"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Amblyopia, or lazy eye, often results from inadequate visual stimuli during critical periods of visual development. Myopia can lead to this condition if not appropriately corrected, as the brain may begin to favor one eye.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the nature of amblyopia and its relationship to visual experience. What factors might lead to the brain not receiving the proper input from one or both eyes?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following statements best describes the lens type used in eyewear for correcting myopia?",
    options: [
      "Convex lenses are used to increase the focal length.",
      "Concave (minus) lenses are used to diverge light rays.",
      "Aspheric lenses are solely used to enhance peripheral vision.",
      "Bifocal lenses are the only option for myopia correction.",
      "Prism lenses are utilized to align visual axes."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Concave (minus) lenses are used in glasses for myopia to diverge light rays before they enter the eye, allowing the light to focus correctly on the retina rather than in front of it.",
    incorrectFeedback: "When considering how myopia is corrected, think about the function of the lens in opposition to the refractive error. What type of lens would counteract the excessive focusing that characterizes myopia?"
