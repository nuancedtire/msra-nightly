# Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the commonest cause of blindness in the UK. It causes central visual loss – the macula being the central part of the retina. Patients often describe having difficulty visualising faces, reading books, and watching television. As suggested by its name, the condition is more common with age, generally beginning in patients in their 50s and 60s.

## Risk Factors
- **Smoking**
- **Hypertension**
- **Obesity**
- **Family history**

## Types and Characteristics
AMD can be categorised into either dry or wet AMD:

- **Wet AMD**:
  - Faster progression
  - Greater risk of sight loss
  - Characterized by new vessel growth on the retina
  - Leads to leakage from blood vessels and fluid exudates

- **Dry AMD**:
  - Slower progression
  - Diagnosed by presence of drusen with progressive central sight loss, without features of wet AMD

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms
The initial symptoms of AMD are generally blurred or distorted vision, commonly manifesting as:
- Difficulty visualising faces
- Problems reading books
- Difficulty watching television
- Progressive worsening over time
- No associated pain or visible changes to the eye

### Diagnostic Tools
1. **Fundoscopy**:
   - Reveals characteristic retina changes
   - Shows drusen (yellow-white deposits on the retina)
   - Number and size of drusen correlate with disease severity
   - Can help distinguish between dry and wet AMD

2. **Amsler Grid**:
   - Used for diagnosis and monitoring progression
   - Patients typically describe horizontal and vertical lines as "wavy" or "missing"
   - Helps assess central sight loss

### Referral Criteria
- Later-stage dry AMD with visual impairment requiring blind registration
- Wet AMD at any stage
- Both should be referred to ophthalmology

## Investigations

- **Primary**:
  - Slit lamp fundoscopy
  - Fundal photography for monitoring progression

- **For Wet AMD**:
  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
  - Fluorescein fundal angiography (second-line if diagnosis uncertain)

- **Additional**:
  - Cardiovascular disease screening blood tests may be appropriate for those without established diagnosis

## Management

### Wet AMD Treatment
1. **Medical**:
   - First-line: Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (e.g., ranibizumab)
   - Works by preventing new blood vessel growth

2. **Adjunct**:
   - Photodynamic therapy as second-line option

### Dry AMD Treatment
- No medical treatments available
- Management is supportive:
  - Visual aids
  - Patient education
  - Monitoring for progression to wet AMD

### Supportive Care (Both Types)
1. Patient education
2. Visual aids
3. Information about registering as sight impaired
4. Access to local support services
5. Support group referrals

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old man presents with progressive central vision loss and reports difficulty reading and watching television. Fundoscopy reveals numerous yellow-white deposits on the retina. Which of the following types of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is most likely responsible for these findings?",
    options: [
      "Dry AMD",
      "Wet AMD",
      "Macular hole",
      "Retinal detachment",
      "Diabetic retinopathy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of numerous drusen (yellow-white deposits) on the retina is characteristic of dry age-related macular degeneration. While wet AMD also leads to central vision loss, it is typically associated with new blood vessel growth and leakage, rather than just drusen. The other conditions listed do not typically present with the findings described.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the characteristics of the types of AMD discussed in the article. One type is associated with drusen and gradual vision loss, while the other leads to more rapid deterioration and is characterized by new vessel growth. Which one do you think correlates with the presence of drusen?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 70-year-old woman visits the ophthalmology clinic after noticing her horizontal and vertical lines appear wavy while looking at an Amsler grid. What is the most appropriate next step in her management?",
    options: [
      "Initiate oral vitamin therapy",
      "Schedule regular follow-up appointments every 6 months",
      "Perform an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan",
      "Refer to a support group for vision impairment",
      "Educate the patient on dry AMD management"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the symptoms of distorted vision indicated by the Amsler grid, performing an OCT scan is essential to assess for the presence of wet AMD or other retinal abnormalities. This imaging technique will help to confirm or rule out further complications.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the implications of the wavy lines reported in the Amsler grid assessment. What diagnostic tool is most useful in evaluating the changes in retinal architecture that could be causing these symptoms?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which lifestyle modification is most likely to reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?",
    options: [
      "Increased physical activity",
      "Quitting smoking",
      "Low-fat diet",
      "Regular screening for cardiovascular diseases",
      "High calcium intake"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Quitting smoking is one of the most significant lifestyle changes that can help reduce the risk of developing AMD. Smoking has been consistently identified as a major risk factor for the disease, contrarily, other options while beneficial, do not have as strong an association with AMD prevention.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the risk factors associated with AMD that were highlighted in the article. Which lifestyle choice stands out as a modifiable risk factor directly linked to this condition?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old man diagnosed with wet AMD receives his first intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. What immediate side effect should he be counseled about post-injection?",
    options: [
      "Severe allergic reaction",
      "Blood in urine",
      "Transient eye discomfort or blurred vision",
      "Headache and dizziness",
      "Visual hallucinations"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Transient eye discomfort or blurred vision is a common side effect following intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. Patients should be informed about these mild and self-limiting symptoms they may experience. Serious reactions are much rarer but can occur.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the common adverse effects associated with ocular injections. It’s critical patients are informed appropriately for what they might experience immediately following treatment."
