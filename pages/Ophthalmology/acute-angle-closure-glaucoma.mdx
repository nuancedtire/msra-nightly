# Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an **ophthalmological emergency** that occurs when the aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber of the eye is blocked, leading to a drastic rise in **intraocular pressure**. It characteristically presents with:

- **Painful red eye**
- **Blurred vision**
- **Halo effect** surrounding lights
- **Nausea**
- **Headache**

On examination, the pupil in the affected eye may be dilated. Patients with suspected acute angle-closure glaucoma should be referred urgently to a specialist eye unit.

## **Immediate Management**

Immediate management includes:

- **Pilocarpine eye drops** to constrict the pupil
- **Intravenous acetazolamide**
- **Analgesia**
- **Anti-emetics**

Once intraocular pressure has been controlled, definitive management is with surgery. The condition is rare but vital to be aware of, as untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma carries a risk of permanent visual loss.

## **Diagnosis**

Diagnosis is initially made clinically, based on the characteristic clinical features described above. The **painful red-eye** is the predominant symptom that should raise suspicion of acute angle-closure glaucoma. 

### **Supportive Examination Findings:**

- Red-eye
- Reduced visual acuity
- Fixed dilated pupil

A clinical diagnosis can be made without a specialist ophthalmological review. A non-specialist can perform:

- External eye examination
- Assessment of visual acuity, visual fields, and pupillary light response
- Fundoscopy

If acute angle-closure glaucoma is suspected, the patient should be urgently referred for assessment and confirmatory investigations.

## **Investigations**

Initial investigations in the acute setting may include:

- **Fundoscopy**
- **Slit-lamp examination**

Immediate management is recommended prior to formal diagnosis, but it is important to confirm the diagnosis before definitive management is initiated.

### **Confirmatory Investigations:**

- **Tonometry** to assess intraocular pressure (pressure > `21 mmHg` supports diagnosis)
- Fundoscopy and slit-lamp examination (typical findings: large optic cup, damage to ocular nerve fibers)

The **gold-standard** diagnostic investigation is **gonioscopy**, performed by specialists, which is used to view the anterior chamber. If the diagnosis is uncertain, **optical coherence tomography** can be used as further imaging.

## **Management (Prescribing)**

Immediate pharmacological management can be initiated in primary care and non-specialist settings, provided the drugs are available. This treatment includes:

- **Pilocarpine eye drops**
- **Oral acetazolamide**
- **Analgesia** and **anti-emetics** if required

*Acute angle-closure glaucoma may cause severe headache and nausea.*

### **Mechanism of Action:**

- **Pilocarpine**: Antimuscarinic that constricts the pupil and opens the trabecular meshwork of the eye to allow increased flow of aqueous humour, reducing intraocular pressure.
- **Acetazolamide**: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that acts as a diuretic to decrease intraocular pressure.

*Patient positioning*: Lying the patient flat can help reduce intraocular pressure.

For patients in whom intraocular pressure remains high despite initial management, **hyperosmotic agents** such as **intravenous mannitol** can be given. Outside of the acute setting, **prostaglandin analogues** like **latanoprost** can be used to manage raised intraocular pressure, especially if surgical measures have not been sufficient.

## **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

Definitive management of acute angle-closure glaucoma is surgical, with the aim to open the angle of the anterior chamber and allow outflow of aqueous humour. 

### **Surgical Options:**

- **Laser iridotomy**: Surgical treatment of choice, creating a hole in the iris.
- **Laser iridoplasty**: Laser cauterisation to contract the iris.
- **Iridectomy**: Removal of a small section of the iris.

For patients with consistently raised intraocular pressure who develop chronic acute angle-closure glaucoma, further surgical options include:

- **Trabeculectomy**: Surgical release of the trabecular meshwork.
- **Aqueous humour shunts**.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old male presents to the urgent care clinic with a painful red eye, blurred vision, and headache. Upon examination, his right pupil is fixed and dilated. His intraocular pressure is measured at 25 mmHg. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Topical timolol",
      "Pilocarpine eye drops",
      "Oral acetazolamide",
      "Intravenous mannitol",
      "Laser iridotomy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Pilocarpine eye drops are the first-line treatment in acute angle-closure glaucoma as they induce miosis, aiding in the outflow of aqueous humor and subsequently reducing intraocular pressure. Subsequent treatments like acetazolamide and mannitol are also important, but initiating with pilocarpine is crucial.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Revisit the initial pharmacological management of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Remember that the goal is to quickly alleviate the pressure and enhance aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber. Which agent works specifically to constrict the pupil and may assist in opening the trabecular meshwork?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with acute angle-closure glaucoma is treated with oral acetazolamide, IV mannitol, and pilocarpine eye drops. After these interventions, the intraocular pressure is still significantly elevated. Which additional treatment should be considered at this stage?",
    options: [
      "Surgical iridectomy",
      "Administration of topical brimonidine",
      "Continuation of oral acetazolamide",
      "Initiation of topical corticosteroids",
      "Enhancement of patient hydration with IV fluids"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Surgical intervention, such as laser iridectomy, is indicated after medical management fails to adequately lower intraocular pressure. It addresses the underlying problem by creating a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider that when medical management is insufficient to control the intraocular pressure, definitive surgical options become necessary. Review the indications for surgery in acute management of this condition—what surgical approach directly helps in alleviating the chronic obstruction?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following findings is most consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma during a physical examination?",
    options: [
      "Increased pupillary light reflex",
      "Hypotony (low intraocular pressure)",
      "Constriction of the pupil",
      "A fixed, dilated pupil with a red eye",
      "Absence of any headache"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A fixed, dilated pupil accompanied by a painful red eye is a classic presentation of acute angle-closure glaucoma, indicative of the increased intraocular pressure and potential mechanical obstruction.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the hallmark symptoms and signs of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Review the characteristic features associated with this eye condition, particularly focusing on eye appearance and pupil response."
  },
  {
    question: "A 70-year-old woman is brought to the clinic for evaluation of chronic eye discomfort. She has a history of angle-closure glaucoma that resolved after laser iridotomy. She now reports intermittent episodes of eye redness and visual disturbances. What type of glaucoma is she likely experiencing?",
    options: [
      "Open-angle glaucoma",
      "Chronic angle-closure glaucoma",
      "Primary congenital glaucoma",
      "Secondary glaucoma",
      "Normal-tension glaucoma"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient's history of angle-closure glaucoma and her current symptoms suggest that she may be experiencing chronic angle-closure glaucoma, characterized by intermittent episodes of increased pressure following the initial acute episode.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the long-term outcomes following acute angle-closure glaucoma. What type of glaucoma can develop from a history of episodes like those seen in this patient? Consider how the history influences future presentations."
