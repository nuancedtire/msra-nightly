# Understanding Cataracts

Cataracts are a **progressive opacification** of an eye’s lens that result in gradual and painless visual changes. They are common and can lead to serious issues, as they are the leading cause of blindness in the world.

## **Diagnosis**

Cataracts can be classified in two main ways:

1. **Age of Onset**:
   - **Presenile** 
   - **Senile** (age-related)

2. **Morphology**:
   - **Nuclear**
   - **Cortical**
   - **Lamellar**
   - **Subcapsular**

The morphological classification refers to the **location within the lens**.

### **Presenile Cataract Causes**
Presenile cataracts can be due to several factors:
- **Congenital**
- **Ocular trauma**
- **Eye diseases** (e.g. anterior uveitis, angle-closure glaucoma)
- **Systemic diseases** (e.g. diabetes, neurofibromatosis type 2, myotonic dystrophy)
- **Drugs** (e.g. steroids)

Cataracts generally cause:
- **Reduced visual acuity**
- **Glare**
- **Halos** around lights

*Left untreated, a congenital cataract can lead to irreversible visual impairment.*

## **Examination and Investigations**

Standard examination methods include:
- **Visual Acuity Testing:** 
  - e.g. Snellen chart 
- **Direct Ophthalmoscopy:** 
  - A cataract may cause leukocoria (white pupil) resulting in a lost red reflex.
  - This is assessed during routine newborn examinations and at the 6-week postnatal check.
- **Slit-Lamp Examination:** 
  - Used by ophthalmologists and optometrists to examine the lens for any opacity.
- **Optical Biometry:** 
  - Measures the axial length of both eyes for appropriate intraocular lens (IOL) implant sizing during surgery.

## **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

Cataract surgery is currently the only treatment that can stop the progression of a cataract, boasting a **high success rate** and a **low complication rate**.

### **Postoperative Complications**
- **Posterior Capsule Opacification:** 
  - Occurs in `10%` of cataract surgeries.
- **Other Rare Complications**:
  - **Endophthalmitis:** (`1 in 1,000`) – Inflammation of the anterior and/or posterior chambers.
  - **Retinal Detachment/Tear:** (`1 in 1,000`)
  - **Choroidal Haemorrhage:** (`1 in 1,000`)
  - **Posterior Capsule Rupture**

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Urgent Care:** Infants with suspected cataracts should be referred urgently to ophthalmology.
</Callout>

Adults should be referred routinely for surgical consideration if the cataract negatively impacts their quality of life or if their visual acuity is worse than `6/6` in either eye.

### **Support for Non-Eligible Patients**
Patients who cannot undergo surgery—either by choice or due to criteria—should be supported with visual aids. *Note: Visual aids cannot prevent or halt cataract progression.*

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old man presents with progressive visual loss in both eyes over the past year. On examination, he is found to have cataracts in both eyes. Which of the following best describes the most common cause of cataracts in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Congenital factors",
      "Ocular trauma",
      "Age-related changes",
      "Systemic diseases such as diabetes",
      "Drug-induced (e.g., steroids)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The most common cause of cataracts in older adults is age-related changes, often referred to as senile cataracts. This type of cataract is primarily associated with the natural aging process of the lens.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the classification of cataracts. While other causes may contribute to cataracts in different age groups, age-related changes are by far the most prevalent category in older populations."
  },
  {
    question: "During a routine eye examination, a 6-week-old infant is found to have leukocoria. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month",
      "Refer urgently to an ophthalmologist",
      "Perform a visual acuity test",
      "Instruct parents on eye hygiene",
      "Administer topical antibiotics"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Leukocoria in an infant can be indicative of serious conditions, including congenital cataracts, and requires urgent referral to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Revisit the significance of leukocoria in infants. It is a critical sign that warrants immediate attention rather than delayed follow-up or conservative measures."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a history of diabetes presents with cataracts. Which of the following systemic conditions is also known to increase the risk of cataract formation?",
    options: [
      "Hyperthyroidism",
      "Chronic kidney disease",
      "Hypertension",
      "Syphilis",
      "Neurofibromatosis type 2"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 5,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Neurofibromatosis type 2 is associated with various ocular conditions, including an increased risk of cataracts. Systemic diseases like diabetes are also well-known risk factors.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the systemic diseases that have been linked to cataract development. Review the conditions listed and how they relate to the formation of cataracts."
  },
  {
    question: "Following cataract surgery, a patient reports persistent visual disturbances. A slit-lamp examination is performed, revealing posterior capsule opacification. What is the most appropriate management for this complication?",
    options: [
      "Repeat cataract surgery",
      "Laser capsulotomy",
      "Intraocular lens exchange",
      "Observation and reassurance",
      "Topical steroids"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Posterior capsule opacification is commonly treated with laser capsulotomy, a quick and effective outpatient procedure that restores visual clarity.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the method used to correct postoperative visual disturbances. What are the standard treatments for complications arising specifically from cataract surgery?"
