# Glaucoma: Understanding Open-Angle Glaucoma

Glaucoma refers to a group of **eye conditions** that lead to damage of the **optic nerve head**, resulting in progressive loss of **retinal ganglion cells** and their axons. One of the most prevalent types is **open-angle glaucoma (OAG)**, where the **iridocorneal angle** (the drainage point for **aqueous humour**) remains open, but the flow through the **trabecular meshwork** is reduced.

## Diagnosis

The most common form of open-angle glaucoma is **primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)**, characterized by:

- **Adult-onset**, painless, **progressive loss of vision**
- **Intraocular pressure** greater than `21 mmHg` (normal range: `10-21 mmHg`)
  - Note: Raised intraocular pressure is not a strict diagnostic criterion; patients presenting with characteristic changes but normal or low intraocular pressure are referred to as having **normal pressure glaucoma** or **low-tension glaucoma**, respectively.
- **Glaucomatous optic neuropathy**
- **Visual field loss** compatible with nerve fibre damage (usually peripheral before central)
- Absence of an underlying cause (hence **primary**)
- Typically affects **both eyes**

### Risk Factors for Developing POAG

Some key risk factors include:

- Increasing age (rarely `<40`, typically `>65` for initial symptoms)
- **Family history**
- **Race** – more prevalent in **Afro-Caribbean** populations
- **Ocular hypertension**
- **Myopia** (in contrast, **hypermetropia** increases the risk of angle-closure glaucoma)
- **Retinal diseases** – such as central retinal vein occlusion, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa
- **Microvascular diseases** – including hypertension and diabetes

Diagnosis relies on a combination of compatible clinical history and characteristic examination findings.

## Investigations

The **National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)** recommends the following investigations for all patients suspected of having OAG:

- **Goldmann tonometry** for intraocular pressure measurement
- **Corneal thickness measurement**
- **Gonioscopy** to assess anterior chamber configuration and depth (i.e., to check if the iridocorneal angle is open or closed)
- **Perimetry** to detect visual field defects
- **Slit-lamp assessment** of the optic nerve and fundus
  - Glaucoma typically leads to increased cupping of the optic nerve head (normal cup-to-disc ratio is `0.3`), but an increase in cupping over time is crucial for diagnosis as some patients may have hereditary causes for increased cupping.
  - **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)** provides precise measurements of the cup-to-disc ratio and excellent visual records of the findings.

## Management (Prescribing)

Management typically begins with prescribing one drug at a time for either one or both eyes. Treatment options for eye drops include:

- **Prostaglandin analogues** (e.g., **latanoprost**) – first-line option
  - Increases uveoscleral outflow
  - **Side effects:** brown iris pigmentation, lengthening of eyelashes
- **Beta-blockers** (e.g., **timolol**)
  - Reduce aqueous secretion
  - **Contraindicated** in asthma, bradycardia, heart block
  - **Side effects:** irritation, erythema, dry eyes
- **Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors** (e.g., **dorzolamide**)
  - Reduce aqueous secretion
  - **Side effects:** localized discomfort, lacrimation, superficial punctate keratitis
- **Sympathomimetics** (e.g., **apraclonidine**)
  - Reduce aqueous secretion and increase outflow through the trabecular meshwork
  - **Side effects:** mydriasis, dry eyes
- **Miotics** (e.g., **pilocarpine**)
  - Open the trabecular meshwork to increase drainage
  - **Side effects:** miosis/blurred vision, pupillary block, brow ache

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Laser and surgical treatments should be considered after two unsuccessful pharmacological treatment trials, despite optimal application and compliance.

### Laser Therapies

- **Laser trabeculoplasty**: Involves lasering of the trabecular meshwork to enhance uveoscleral outflow.

### Surgical Interventions

- **Surgical trabeculectomy**: This is the most common form of surgical intervention for OAG. It creates a fistula between the anterior chamber of the eye and the **sub-tenon space** around the globe to improve outflow.

  {
    question: "A 72-year-old patient is diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). During your examination, you find an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 24 mmHg and observe characteristic visual field defects. Which diagnostic test is crucial for confirming the presence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy?",
    options: [
      "Goldmann tonometry",
      "Gonioscopy",
      "Optical coherence tomography (OCT)",
      "Corneal thickness measurement",
      "Perimetry"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is essential for confirming glaucomatous optic neuropathy by providing detailed imaging of the optic nerve head, particularly by assessing the cup-to-disc ratio. This test can highlight subtle changes in the optic nerve that are characteristic of glaucoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the recommended investigations in the diagnosis of glaucoma. While tests like Goldmann tonometry measure IOP and perimetry assesses visual fields, to confirm glaucomatous damage specifically, what imaging technique provides precise structural analysis of the optic nerve?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following medications is considered the first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma and works by increasing uveoscleral outflow?",
    options: [
      "Timolol",
      "Dorzolamide",
      "Latanoprost",
      "Apraclonidine",
      "Pilocarpine"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue, is the first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma and functions by enhancing uveoscleral outflow. It's important to recognize how different classes of medications affect aqueous humor dynamics to optimize treatment strategies.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the various classes of glaucoma medications and their mechanisms. While timolol is a beta-blocker that decreases aqueous production, consider what medication specifically increases drainage through the uveoscleral pathway and is used primarily as an initial therapeutic agent."

  {
    question: "During a routine check-up, a 65-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension complains of recent vision changes. Assessment reveals a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.5 and visual field loss in the peripheral areas. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Primary angle-closure glaucoma",
      "Normal tension glaucoma",
      "Primary open-angle glaucoma",
      "Secondary glaucoma due to retinal detachment",
      "Acute glaucoma attack"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the age, findings of increased cup-to-disc ratio, and progressive peripheral vision loss, primary open-angle glaucoma is the most likely diagnosis. The absence of acute symptoms points away from angle-closure glaucoma or an acute attack.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Examine the common presentations of glaucoma and the differences in their clinical manifestations. Consider the chronic nature of the symptoms presented and how they relate to the changes in the retinal structure typically noted in open-angle glaucoma."

    question: "A patient with open-angle glaucoma is not responding adequately to their current topical medication regimen, which includes a prostaglandin analogue and a beta-blocker. What is the next appropriate step in management?",
    options: [
      "Increase the dose of the current beta-blocker",
      "Introduce a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor",
      "Switch to a different prostaglandin analogue",
      "Refer for laser trabeculoplasty",
      "Start oral acetazolamide"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Introducing a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor as an adjunct therapy is appropriate for patients who are inadequately controlled on their current regimen. The goal is to boost IOP reduction without compromising patient quality of life.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the management principles of glaucoma, especially when current treatments are insufficient. What classes of drugs can be added to enhance intraocular pressure control while balancing the risks and benefits of further interventions?"
