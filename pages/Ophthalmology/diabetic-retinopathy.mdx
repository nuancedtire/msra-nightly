# Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic progressive retinal complication of diabetes mellitus caused by microvascular leakage and occlusion. DR is split into two main categories:

1. **Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)**: the less advanced and earlier stage form.
2. **Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)**: the more advanced and potentially sight-threatening form.

As many patients with DR are asymptomatic, a national screening programme in the UK has been established using annual digital retinal photography to identify diabetic patients at risk of severe ocular disease. In addition to general measures to optimize a patient’s DR risk factors, DR can be managed using intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF or laser photocoagulation to reverse and/or prevent the proliferative changes seen in PDR.

## Diagnosis

DR usually develops as a long-term complication of hyperglycaemia and is present in only a minority of patients at the time of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The incidence of DR at `15 years` after diagnosis is over `90%` in type 1 diabetes patients and `60%` in type 2 diabetes patients.

Symptoms are uncommon but can develop later in the disease course, such as:

- **Floaters**
- **Loss of vision** due to macular oedema (gradual) or vitreous haemorrhage (acute).

### Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy

Classification of DR is based on ophthalmoscopic signs. The national screening programme still uses the traditional background/pre-proliferative and proliferative grading system, but a more detailed classification has been adopted by ophthalmologists:

- **Mild NPDR**: Haemorrhages (dot or blot) or microaneurysms only.
- **Moderate NPDR**: Severe retinal haemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, hard exudates, venous beading, and/or intra-retinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA).
- **Severe NPDR**: Severe retinal haemorrhages in all four retinal quadrants, venous beading in two quadrants, and/or extensive IRMA.
- **PDR**: New vessels on the disc (NVD) or new vessels elsewhere (NVE) on the retina due to ischaemia; iris neovascularisation suggests severe PDR. Potential complications of PDR include vitreous haemorrhage, retinal fibrosis, and traction retinal detachment.

## Investigations

- **Digital retinal photography**: The basis of the screening programme.
- **Fluorescein angiography**: May be used to guide laser treatment.
- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Used to detect the presence of macular oedema and other signs of macular retinopathy.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

DR can be prevented, or its progression halted by optimizing glycaemic, lipid, and hypertensive risk factors.

All patients with diabetes mellitus above the age of `12 years` are invited for an annual* dilated fundus photographic exam. This is changing to a `2-year` interval for people with a low risk of sight loss.

| Grade (Traditional)      | Follow-up                                      | Treatment                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| None/Background          | Regular screening                              | No                                    |
| Pre-Proliferative        | Routine referral to ophthalmology               | Consider PRP*                         |
| Proliferative (PDR)     | Urgent referral to ophthalmology (seen within `2 weeks`) | PRP, Anti-VEGF                      |

* PRP = pan-retinal laser photocoagulation

## Management (Treatments)

- **Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)**: Increasingly used as a treatment for PDR.
- **Pan-retinal laser photocoagulation**: An alternative treatment aimed to destroy and reduce the area of ischaemic retinal tissue, thereby reducing VEGF production.
- **Intravitreal corticosteroid therapy**: Another option for refractory cases.
- **Vitrectomy surgery**: Can relieve vitreous haemorrhage or retinal traction.
