# Acute Iritis (Anterior Uveitis)

Acute iritis, also known as anterior uveitis, is an **inflammatory condition** affecting the uvea, which is the pigmented portion of the eye. The uvea consists of the **iris**, **ciliary body**, and **choroid**. In anterior uveitis or iritis, the **iris** and **ciliary body** become inflamed. Choroid inflammation is known as **posterior uveitis**, and when all parts of the uvea are involved, it is referred to as **pan-uveitis**.

## **Symptoms**

Iritis is characterized by a **painful red eye** associated with:

- **Blurred vision**
- **Photophobia** (sensitivity to light)
- **Excessive lacrimation** (tearing)
- **Reduced visual acuity**

It is one of the key differentials for red-eye, alongside **acute angle-closure glaucoma** and **conjunctivitis**.

## **Causes**

Iritis can be caused by several factors, including:

- **Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions**:
  - Ankylosing spondylitis
  - Sarcoidosis
  - Inflammatory bowel disease

- **Infectious agents**:
  - HIV
  - Tuberculosis
  - Syphilis
  - Herpes

- **Idiopathic** (often with no identifiable cause)

The **HLA-B27** genotype is commonly associated with acute iritis. Acute iritis typically resolves with treatment within **days to weeks**; however, a minimum of **six weeks** of treatment is often required to ensure complete resolution of inflammation. Some individuals may develop recurrent or chronic uveitis.

## **Diagnosis**

As mentioned, acute iritis is a key differential diagnosis for a painful red eye. The symptoms typically develop over the course of `hours` to `days` and are generally unilateral.    

**Clinical features include**:

- **Pain and redness**
- **Blurred vision**
- **Excessive lacrimation** (without discharge, unlike conjunctivitis)
- **Photophobia**
- **Reduced visual acuity** (but can occur without affecting vision)

### **Examination Techniques**

A full eye examination should be performed, including:

1. **Assessment of visual acuity**
2. **Visual fields testing**
3. **Pupillary light response evaluation**
4. **Fundoscopic examination**    

If available, a **slit lamp examination** may show white precipitates on the cornea. 

**Refer** any patient with suspected iritis to ophthalmology for formal diagnosis and review. There is no specific diagnostic test, though **Talbot’s test** is very specific for iritis—this test is positive if the patient reports increased pain when asked to converge their gaze.

## **Investigations**

There are no specific investigations for acute iritis, aside from fundoscopy and slit-lamp examinations. While blood tests are generally unnecessary for diagnosis, they may be important for assessing potential underlying causes, such as:

- **Inflammatory disease screening**
- **Rheumatological assays**
- **Chest X-rays** (due to association with tuberculosis and sarcoidosis)

**HLA-B27 testing** may be necessary due to the association with diseases like ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. These investigations are rarely required for isolated episodes of acute iritis but should be arranged if the patient has:

- Recurrent iritis
- Bilateral disease
- Suspicion of an underlying cause

## **Management (Prescribing)**

The management of acute iritis is primarily **medical**, with topical treatments as the mainstay. The following are commonly used:

- **Steroid eye drops** (e.g., `0.5-1% prednisolone`) to reduce inflammation and pain
- **Cyclopentolate 0.5% eye drops** for pupil dilation to ease pressure on the eye (may cause blurred vision, so typically given early in the disease course)

Steroid eye drops are administered for **several weeks** as part of a reducing course. 

**Latanoprost eye drops** may also be utilized to reduce **intraocular pressure** if elevated, which can occur due to inflammation or corticosteroid use. 

Acute iritis generally settles with treatment within **days to weeks**, but a minimum of **six weeks** is typically required to ensure complete resolution of inflammation.

## **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

Regular review is crucial for ensuring adequate resolution of inflammation, typically performed in an **ophthalmology outpatient clinic**. Potential complications include:

- **Glaucoma**
- **Cataracts** (due to prolonged inflammation damaging the eye)

It is important to advise patients on:

- The natural history of the disease and potential for recurrence
- Avoiding driving when their vision is blurry or while using dilating eye drops

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old man with a history of ankylosing spondylitis presents with a painful red eye, photophobia, and blurred vision that developed over the last two days. On examination, he is found to have a constricted pupil in the affected eye and significant discomfort with light. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Conjunctivitis",
      "Acute angle-closure glaucoma",
      "Acute iritis",
      "Retinal detachment",
      "Corneal abrasion"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's symptoms of a painful red eye, photophobia, blurred vision, and a history of ankylosing spondylitis suggest acute iritis. The additional finding of a constricted pupil further supports this diagnosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the characteristic symptoms and examination findings in this case. Focus on how the pupil's response to light might differ in various eye conditions, and think about the associations with underlying systemic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with acute iritis is treated with topical steroid eye drops. What is the primary goal of this treatment?",
    options: [
      "To induce pupil dilation",
      "To prevent secondary infections",
      "To reduce inflammation and alleviate pain",
      "To lower intraocular pressure",
      "To promote corneal healing"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Topical steroid eye drops are primarily used in acute iritis to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain associated with the condition.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the roles of different treatments in managing acute iritis. Focus on which symptoms are most prevalent in this condition and how steroids address those symptoms."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following investigations would be most useful in a patient presenting with recurrent acute iritis to assess for potential underlying causes?",
    options: [
      "Blood glucose levels",
      "Chest X-ray",
      "Complete blood count",
      "HLA-B27 testing",
      "Viral load testing for HIV"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! HLA-B27 testing is useful in evaluating patients with recurrent iritis, as it is associated with several inflammatory conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the most common associations of acute iritis with specific conditions. Which tests are designed to look for genetic markers or inflammatory diseases that could explain repeated episodes of eye inflammation?"
  },
  {
    question: "In managing acute iritis, which of the following is NOT a recommended treatment approach?",
    options: [
      "Topical steroids",
      "Cycloplegic eye drops",
      "Antibiotic eye drops",
      "Regular ophthalmologic follow-up",
      "Assessment of intraocular pressure"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Antibiotic eye drops are not typically indicated unless there is a secondary bacterial infection. The management primarily involves topical steroids and cycloplegics.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the underlying pathology of acute iritis and what the primary goal of treatment is. Reflect on treatment modalities specific to inflammatory conditions versus those meant for infections."
