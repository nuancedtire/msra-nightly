# Toxic Optic Neuropathy (TON)

Toxic optic neuropathy (TON) is a visual impairment due to optic nerve damage caused by a toxin. This article outlines the diagnosis, investigations, and management strategies for TON.

## Diagnosis

Toxic optic neuropathy is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients typically present with:

- **A history of drug, medications, or alcohol use**
- **Painless, bilateral, and symmetric vision loss**
- **Progressive loss of visual acuity** that usually starts with a blur at the point of fixation
- **Dyschromatopsia**
- **Central or cecocentral scotoma** with preservation of the peripheral fields
- **Papillomacular bundle loss**

### Differential Diagnosis

The main differentials include neurological causes of visual impairment and metabolic diseases, which can include:

- Diabetes mellitus
- Kidney failure
- Liver disease
- Thyroid disease
- Hereditary optic nerve disorders

### Common Causes of TON

The prevalence of toxic optic neuropathy varies by drug type and duration of usage. The effects are usually dose-dependent. Common causes include:

- **Alcohols:** Commercial alcohol, Methanol, Ethylene glycol
- **Antibiotics:** Chloramphenicol, Sulphonamides, Linezolid
- **Antimalarials:** Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine, Quinine
- **Antituberculars:** Isoniazid, Ethambutol, Streptomycin
- **Antiarrhythmics:** Digoxin, Amiodarone
- **Anticancer agents:** Vincristine, Methotrexate, Tamoxifen
- **PDE inhibitors:** Sildenafil
- **Heavy metals:** Lead, Mercury, Thallium
- **Others:** Carbon Monoxide, Tobacco

## Investigations

Investigations to support the diagnosis of toxic optic neuropathy include:

1. **Slit-lamp examination**
   - May show deposits of the drug (e.g., amiodarone).
   
2. **Visual evoked potential testing**
   - Possible delayed transmission.
   
3. **Optical coherence tomography**
   - Can demonstrate loss of retinal nerve fibers (e.g., due to ethambutol or linezolid toxicity).

4. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**
   - Of the optic nerves and chiasm, with and without gadolinium contrast.
   - Essential to rule out other causes, such as compressive lesions.

5. **Urinalysis**
   - To screen for specific toxins and perform heavy metal screening if suspected.

6. **Serum B12 and red cell folate levels**
   - To exclude deficiency-related neuropathy if bilateral central scotomas are present.

## Management (Prescribing)

Management of toxic optic neuropathy is dictated by the specific toxin. Treatments for selected drugs are listed below:

- **Ethambutol:** 
  - Use Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) for treatment and prevention.
  
- **Alcohols (Methanol and Ethylene Glycol):**
  - Administer buffers like sodium bicarbonate to correct metabolic acidosis.
  - Use an antidote such as ethanol or fomepizole.
  - Haemodialysis may be necessary in severe cases of metabolic acidosis.
  - IV pulse steroids have shown promising results for salvaging vision.

- **Lead Toxicity:**
  - Remove the source of exposure.
  - Treat with chelating agents (e.g., penicillamine, intramuscular dimercaprol, disodium calcium EDTA).
  - For encephalopathy, consider oral succimer treatment.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

The immediate step in treating toxic optic neuropathy is to **remove the offending agent**. This can often reverse the process of optic neuropathy.

- Monitor patients every `4-6 weeks` and, depending on recovery, every `6-12 months` thereafter.
- Follow-up examinations should include assessment of:
  - Visual acuity
  - Pupils
  - Optic nerves
  - Colour vision
  - Visual fields

<summary>Common Signs and Symptoms</summary>

- **Chest Pain**
  - Crushing or pressure-like
  - May radiate to left arm, jaw, or back
  - Often accompanied by sweating

- **Respiratory Symptoms**
  - Shortness of breath
  - Rapid breathing
  - Orthopnea

- **Other Symptoms**
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Fatigue
  - Light-headedness
  - Anxiety

    question: "A 45-year-old man presents with progressive loss of vision over the past two weeks. He has a history of methanol use. On examination, he shows bilateral central scotomas and dyschromatopsia. Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in confirming the diagnosis of toxic optic neuropathy?",
    options: [
      "Slit-lamp examination",
      "Visual field testing",
      "Optical coherence tomography",
      "Serum methanol level",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Optical coherence tomography is particularly useful in assessing retinal nerve fiber loss, which can confirm the underlying optic nerve damage associated with toxic optic neuropathy due to methanol. This is a key diagnostic tool for visualizing the impact of toxins on the optic nerve.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While some of the listed investigations may provide supportive information, consider which test provides direct visual evidence of damage to the optic nerve fibers. Think about how specific imaging techniques could directly demonstrate the effects of methanol toxicity on the optic structure."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient is diagnosed with toxic optic neuropathy secondary to ethambutol use. What is the most appropriate immediate management strategy to minimize visual impairment?",
    options: [
      "Initiate pyridoxine supplementation",
      "Administer corticosteroids intravenously",
      "Discontinue ethambutol and monitor",
      "Start chelation therapy for heavy metal toxicity",
      "Perform ocular surgery to repair optic nerve damage"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The immediate step in managing ethambutol-induced toxic optic neuropathy is to start pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation. This strategy is recommended for both treatment and prevention of optic neuropathy caused by ethambutol.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the specific mechanism of toxicity involved with ethambutol and why removal of the offending agent is essential. Consider also any specific antidotes or supportive treatments that are indicated for the specific toxin involved."

    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! After initial treatment, patients with toxic optic neuropathy should indeed be monitored every 4-6 weeks, and then every 6-12 months as needed, depending on their recovery. This regular monitoring is crucial to assess progress and adjust management as necessary.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the rationale behind follow-up care in cases of optic nerve damage. What is the goal of regular assessments in these patients? Consider the progressive nature of visual disturbances and the timeline for recovery following toxic exposure."
