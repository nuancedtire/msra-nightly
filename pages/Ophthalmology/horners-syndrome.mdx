# Horner's Syndrome: Diagnosis and Management

Horner's syndrome occurs when the sympathetic nervous supply to the eye is damaged. This sympathetic pathway starts in the hypothalamus, goes via the brainstem and cervical spinal cord to the `T1` nerve root, then passes along the wall of the carotid artery, to the eye. Horner's syndrome is an important diagnosis to recognize as it can be caused by a range of serious pathology.

## Diagnosis

There is a range of pathology that can cause Horner's syndrome, ranging from benign to malignant. The causes are summarized in the table below:

| Area of the sympathetic pathway to the eye affected | Pathology |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Hypothalamic, hemisphere and brainstem lesions** | Massive stroke |
|                                                   | Brainstem demyelination or infarction in the lateral medulla |
| **Cervical spinal cord**                           | Syringomyelia |
|                                                   | Cervical spinal cord tumors |
| **T1 nerve root**                                  | Apical lung tumor (Pancoast tumor) |
|                                                   | Cervical rib |
|                                                   | Brachial plexus trauma e.g. during birth |
| **Sympathetic chain and carotid artery in the neck** | Following surgery to the carotid artery, thyroid or larynx |
|                                                   | Carotid artery dissection |
|                                                   | Malignant tumor |
| **Other**                                         | Congenital |
|                                                   | Idiopathic |
|                                                   | Cluster headache – usually resolves within hours |
|                                                   | Otitis media and herpes zoster in the middle ear |
|                                                   | Neuroblastoma in children if new-onset |

Characteristically, there are **three features** of Horner’s syndrome:

- **Ptosis** 
- **Unilateral miosis** (with normal light reflex)
- **Lack of sweating** on the ipsilateral side

Patients with Horner’s syndrome may also experience:

- Headaches
- Pain and flushing of the face
- Lighter pigmentation of the iris on the affected side (if congenital)

## Investigations

It is important to take a history including pain, trauma, and surgery, and to examine for the involvement of other cranial nerves. To confirm Horner’s syndrome, use apraclonidine eye drops. If the pupil has dilated after `1 hour` with the drops, this is a positive result.

The cause of Horner’s syndrome must be found. Investigations may include:

- MRI brain or spinal cord (if suspecting brain or spinal cord pathology)
- CXR/CT thorax (for a Pancoast or apical lung tumor)
- Carotid doppler (carotid artery dissection or tumor)
- MRI of the neck (neck pathology, including thyroid tumor and enlarged cervical nodes) and lymph node biopsy.

## Management (Prescribing and Non-Prescribing)

The management of Horner's syndrome depends on the cause. Urgent referral to other specialties may be required. The prognosis and recovery of the patient depend on the underlying cause and how treatable it is.

<summary>Important Considerations</summary>

- **Referral**: Ensure timely referral for potential surgical interventions or further investigations based on the underlying etiology.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of symptoms and neurological status is essential.
