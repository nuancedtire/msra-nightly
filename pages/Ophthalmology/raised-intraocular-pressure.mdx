# Ocular Hypertension: Diagnosis and Management

## Overview

**Ocular hypertension** is characterized by elevated intraocular pressure exceeding the normal range of `10-21 mmHg`, primarily attributed to the aqueous and vitreous humour.

## Diagnosis

Identifying ocular hypertension is essential, especially since it does not always lead to glaucoma. To differentiate it from glaucoma, the following criteria must be met:

- **Intraocular Pressure (IOP)**: Measurement over `21 mmHg`.
- **Visual Fields**: Normal visual fields (no peripheral field loss).
- **Optic Disc Appearance**: Normal appearance (no optic nerve cupping).
- **Exclusion of Other Conditions**: No other eye diseases causing temporary IOP elevation.

*Although ocular hypertension is not a disease in itself, close monitoring is imperative due to the increased risk of glaucoma development.*

## Investigations

According to NICE, individuals with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension should undergo these essential investigations:

- **Goldmann Tonometry**: For precise IOP measurement.
- **Corneal Thickness Measurement**: Assess the risk of glaucoma.
- **Gonioscopy**: Evaluate anterior chamber configuration and depth.
- **Perimetry**: Detect potential visual field defects.
- **Slit-Lamp Assessment**: Examine the optic nerve and fundus.

## Management (Prescribing)

Treatment is often unnecessary for mild ocular hypertension. Referral to an ophthalmologist may be warranted based on:

1. Patient age
2. Intriguocular pressure (IOP)
3. Central corneal thickness
4. Development of glaucoma signs

### Common Treatment Options

Generally, one medication is initiated at a time, which may be administered in one or both eyes. Commonly prescribed eye drops include:

| Medication Class                    | Example          | Mechanism of Action                             | Side Effects                                         |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Prostaglandin Analogues             | Latanoprost      | Increases uveoscleral outflow                  | Brown iris pigmentation, lengthening of eyelashes   |
| Beta-Blockers                       | Timolol          | Reduces aqueous secretion                      | Irritation, erythema, dry eyes; contraindicated in asthma |
| Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors      | Dorzolamide      | Reduces aqueous secretion                      | Localized discomfort, lacrimation, superficial punctate keratitis |
| Sympathomimetics                   | Apraclonidine    | Reduces aqueous secretion, increases outflow   | Mydriasis, dry eyes                                 |
| Miotics                             | Pilocarpine      | Opens trabecular meshwork                       | Miosis/blurred vision, brow ache                    |

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

For isolated ocular hypertension, laser or surgical interventions are generally **not recommended**. These are reserved for patients who have progressed to glaucoma. 

### Patient Advice

Patients should be counseled on the following:

- **Treatment Adherence**: Critical to prevent vision loss.
- **Facilitating Eye Drop Administration**: 
  - Use of an eye drop dispenser for those with physical difficulties.
- **Minimizing Systemic Absorption**: 
  - Close eyes for `3 minutes` after instillation, and gently press the lacrimal sac to reduce systemic absorption by about 50%.
- **Reducing Local Adverse Effects**: 
  - Blotting excess drops with a clean, dry tissue post-instillation.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 55-year-old male presents for a routine eye examination. His IOP is measured at 24 mmHg, but he has no visual field defects and normal optic nerve appearance. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Initiate treatment with latanoprost eye drops.",
      "Refer to ophthalmology for surgical evaluation.",
      "Schedule regular monitoring with repeat IOP checks.",
      "Start oral acetazolamide.",
      "Advise immediate treatment to prevent glaucoma."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the absence of glaucoma signs such as visual field defects or optic nerve damage, the patient is diagnosed with ocular hypertension. Regular monitoring is crucial, as treatment may not be necessary at this time. Referral to ophthalmology would be appropriate if the IOP remains elevated or if other risk factors for glaucoma are present.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the significance of the visual field assessment and optic nerve appearance in your clinical decision-making. Initiating treatment may not be necessary in the absence of glaucomatous changes. What would be the implications of establishing a monitoring regimen instead?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 60-year-old woman with ocular hypertension is prescribed timolol eye drops. Which of the following side effects should she be informed about?",
    options: [
      "Blurry vision upon administration",
      "Increased pigmentation of the iris",
      "Dry mouth and systemic absorption",
      "Irritation and dry eyes",
      "Lengthening of eyelashes"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Timolol, a beta-blocker, is known to cause local irritation and can lead to dry eyes. Patients should be informed about the possibility of these side effects, especially if they have a history of asthma as it may be contraindicated.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the common side effects associated with beta-blockers used in ocular therapy. What local effects might you anticipate if this medication is used long-term?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following investigations is most critical in determining the risk of glaucoma in a patient with ocular hypertension?",
    options: [
      "Slit-lamp assessment",
      "Perimetry",
      "Goldmann tonometry",
      "Corneal thickness measurement",
      "Gonioscopy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Corneal thickness measurement is crucial because a thinner cornea is associated with a higher risk of glaucoma. This measurement helps in assessing the individual risk profile for the development of glaucoma in patients with ocular hypertension.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the parameters that significantly influence glaucoma risk. While all listed tests are valuable, consider which one provides direct insight into structural predispositions."
