# Understanding Postpartum Depression

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a condition that can develop in women after childbirth, potentially manifesting as depression or bipolar affective disorder. While the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) does not recognize PPD as a distinct entity, it does allow for the recording of depression onset within 4 weeks after childbirth. However, symptoms may appear within 6-12 months post-delivery and can still be classified as postnatal depression.

## Etiology of Postpartum Depression

The cause of postpartum depression is not fully understood but is thought to be a mix of psychological, social, and biological factors:

- **Psychosocial Factors:**
  - Significant life events
  - Lack of social support
  - Experience of violence
  - Financial struggles, including low income or unemployment
  - Persistent adverse circumstances

- **Psychiatric History:**
  - Increased risk in women with prior anxiety or depression

- **Personality Traits:**
  - Low self-esteem
  - Neuroticism

- **Familial and Genetic Influences:**
  - Family history of psychiatric illness in first-degree relatives

- **Sleep Disturbances:**
  - Correlation between infant sleep patterns, maternal fatigue, and depression

- **Pregnancy and Birth Complications**
- **Young Maternal Age**

The pathophysiology behind PPD is not clear, but theories suggest that affected women may have a heightened sensitivity to the physiological changes occurring during childbirth or an exaggerated inflammatory response post-labor.

## Diagnosis of Postpartum Depression

It is crucial for healthcare providers, including GPs, nurses, midwives, and health visitors, to recognize the common symptoms of postpartum depression, which may include:

- Depressed mood
- Anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure)
- Weight fluctuations
- Sleeping difficulties
- Fatigue
- Low confidence or self-esteem
- Poor concentration
- Suicidal thoughts

"Baby blues" typically arise 2-3 days post-delivery and resolve within two weeks, whereas postnatal psychosis is a more severe condition that may present with manic or depressive psychosis, which is a medical emergency. Psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or delusions significantly increase the risk of harm to the mother or baby.

Both DSM-5 and ICD-11 categorize postpartum-onset depression using the criteria for a depressive episode, which includes having five or more core symptoms, such as low mood or anhedonia, over a two-week period. These symptoms should not be attributable to substance use, a medical condition, or explainable by a psychotic disorder, and must not be related to a manic or hypomanic episode.

## Investigations for Postpartum Depression

Healthcare providers should inquire about the mental health of women both during pregnancy and postnatally by asking:

- Feelings of being down, depressed, or hopeless in the past month
- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities in the past month

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is commonly used to evaluate suspected PPD. Additionally, screening for mania and hypomania with the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is important. Other tests to exclude organic causes include:

- Thyroid function tests to rule out postnatal thyroiditis
- Full blood count to exclude anemia
- Urine drug screen for substance abuse detection
- Brain imaging, such as CT or MRI, may be considered if pathology is suspected

## Management of Postpartum Depression

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

Primary care typically organizes and carries out treatment for PPD. Urgent referral to specialist services is necessary for women with suicidal ideation, thoughts of harming their child, or experiencing severe episodes of psychosis or bipolar disorder.

For mild to moderate depression, consider:

- Guided self-help resources or computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
- Non-directive counseling, possible through home visits
- Brief CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)

In cases of severe postpartum depression, or moderate depression with a history of severe depression, consider:

- CBT or IPT
- A combination of psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy

### Prescribing Interventions

Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for PPD as with other depressive disorders, but breastfeeding necessitates a careful risk-benefit evaluation. Medication should only be initiated if psychological interventions are unsuccessful or if the patient prefers pharmacotherapy.

- Sertraline, paroxetine, and nortriptyline have minimal presence in breast milk and are preferred.
- Fluoxetine and citalopram are avoided due to higher concentrations in breast milk.
- Tricyclic antidepressants are not recommended due to toxicity risks.
- Lack of data precludes the recommendation of mirtazapine and venlafaxine.
- St John's wort should be avoided by breastfeeding patients.

Monitoring is required to detect the onset of hypomanic or manic episodes during antidepressant therapy.
