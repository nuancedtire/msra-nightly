# Understanding Panic Disorder

Panic disorder is characterized by recurring unexpected panic attacks, often leading to concern about additional attacks and their impact on daily life. This article delves into the causes, diagnosis, and management of panic disorder, providing comprehensive insights into this anxiety disorder.

## Overview of Panic Disorder

Panic disorder involves repeated panic attacks that are abrupt surges of intense fear or discomfort, which can happen unexpectedly or be situationally predisposed. The fear of future attacks and their consequences can significantly disrupt a person's life.

### Etiology

The development of panic disorder is influenced by a mix of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors:

- **Genetic Predisposition:** A person is five times more likely to develop panic disorder if a first-degree relative is affected.
- **Environmental Triggers:** Certain environmental features may act as triggers.
- **Psychological Factors:** Life stressors, trauma, and negative life events can predispose one to panic disorder. An elevated state of alertness or hypervigilance to triggers can activate an intense fight or flight response to otherwise normal physical sensations.

### Pathophysiology

While the exact pathophysiology remains unclear, neuroimaging studies implicate the amygdala and possibly the thalamus, hypothalamus, and hippocampus in the disorder.

The interplay between various brain regions, including the amygdala, is believed to contribute to the heightened anxiety response seen in panic disorder.

### Prognosis

With treatment, the prognosis for panic disorder is positive. Longitudinal studies indicate high remission rates, with 96% at two years, 77% at five years, and 67% at seven years. Exposure therapy, even if not completed fully, can provide symptom relief.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing panic disorder involves patient history, clinical interviews, and behavior observation, with an emphasis on ruling out other conditions that could trigger panic-like symptoms.

### DSM-5 Criteria for Panic Attacks

- Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks.
- At least one month of concern about additional attacks or their implications, or four or more attacks within four weeks.
- Behavioral changes due to the attacks, such as avoidance of certain situations.
- Symptoms not caused by substance use, medical conditions, or other mental health disorders.

### Screening Tools

- `PRIME-MD`: A questionnaire that screens for panic attacks and associated symptoms experienced in the past month.
- `GAD-7`: A tool to assess anxiety severity, which can also detect panic-related symptoms.

## Investigations

Routine blood tests and imaging are not typically necessary. However, if symptoms suggest an organic cause, additional tests like thyroid function tests, blood glucose levels, or an Electrocardiogram (ECG) might be warranted.

### Management of Emergencies

During a panic attack, patients might experience a range of symptoms, including palpitations, sweating, and chest pain. Patients should be reassured, encouraged to breathe deeply, and reminded that the attack will pass. In emergency departments, patients may require oxygen, monitoring of vital signs, and potentially an ECG.

## Non-Prescribing Management Strategies

Educating patients about panic disorder and reassuring them of the non-dangerous nature of panic attacks are crucial. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and self-help based on CBT principles can be effective in helping patients manage their symptoms. Coordination of care is essential throughout treatment.

## Prescribing Management

While benzodiazepines may be used acutely in emergency settings, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are the first-line therapy for longer-term management. If symptoms persist after trying two different SSRIs, Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) may be considered. Pharmacotherapy is generally recommended for at least 12 months after a positive response to treatment to minimize relapse risk.

**Note:** It is crucial to inform patients that the effects of SSRIs or SNRIs may take up to 12 weeks to become apparent.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old woman presents with palpitations, dizziness, and a fear of dying. These episodes occur unexpectedly and are accompanied by a fear of having another attack. She has no significant past medical history. Which of the following is the initial step in management for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Initiate treatment with a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI)",
      "Refer the patient for urgent cardiac evaluation",
      "Provide patient education and reassurance about panic disorder",
      "Prescribe a high dose of benzodiazepines for immediate relief",
      "Order a thyroid function test and blood glucose level"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The first step in managing a patient with symptoms suggestive of panic disorder is to provide patient education and reassurance about the nature of panic attacks. Although the symptoms can mimic serious conditions, reassurance is crucial as part of an initial non-prescribing strategy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While medication and investigations may be necessary in some cases, consider what initial non-pharmacological approach would be appropriate for a patient presenting with symptoms of panic disorder."
  },
  {
    question: "A 36-year-old man with a history of panic disorder controlled with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) presents with a recent increase in panic attack frequency. He has had four attacks in the last month. He expresses a fear of having more attacks and has been avoiding public spaces. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Discontinue CBT as it is no longer effective",
      "Begin an SSRI and continue CBT",
      "Start high-dose benzodiazepines for immediate symptom control",
      "Recommend additional exposure therapy sessions",
      "Schedule for routine blood tests and imaging"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the recurrence of panic attacks despite CBT, initiating an SSRI while continuing CBT is appropriate. SSRIs are the first-line pharmacotherapy for panic disorder, and CBT remains an essential component of treatment.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that a combination of pharmacotherapy and continued psychotherapy is typically beneficial for patients with panic disorder whose symptoms are not adequately controlled."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following best describes the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for panic attacks?",
    options: [
      "Recurrent panic attacks with at least one attack being situationally bound",
      "Symptoms primarily caused by substance use, medical conditions, or other mental health disorders",
      "At least one month of concern or behavioral changes due to the attacks and recurrent, unexpected panic attacks",
      "Four or more panic attacks within a one-year period",
      "A single unexpected panic attack followed by a significant change in behavior"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The DSM-5 criteria for panic attacks include recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one month of concern about additional attacks or behavioral changes due to the attacks, and symptoms not attributable to substance use, medical conditions, or other mental health disorders.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the DSM-5 criteria for panic attacks to identify the key components required for diagnosis."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with panic disorder has tried two different SSRIs without significant improvement in symptoms. According to the management strategy for panic disorder, which of the following would be an appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?",
    options: [
      "Increase the dose of the current SSRI to the maximum tolerated",
      "Add a benzodiazepine to the current SSRI regimen",

      "Consider a Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA)",
      "Discontinue all medication and focus solely on CBT"

    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! If a patient with panic disorder does not respond to two different SSRIs, considering a Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA) is an appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the stepwise approach to pharmacotherapy for panic disorder after SSRIs have been trialed without success."
