# Understanding Anorexia Nervosa

Anorexia nervosa, commonly known as anorexia, is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder marked by an intense pursuit of thinness, extreme weight loss, and a distorted body image. Predominantly affecting young women and often beginning in adolescence, anorexia does not discriminate and can impact individuals of any age, including men and boys. Untreated anorexia carries a significant mortality rate, approximately 10%, largely due to severe physical complications and a heightened risk of suicide.

Anorexia's origins are complex and multifactorial, combining genetic vulnerabilities with environmental and psychodynamic factors stemming from personal and familial experiences. Despite its grave potential outcomes, the disorder is clinically diagnosable through established criteria.

## Diagnosis

The process of diagnosing anorexia nervosa is clinical, relying on a full psychiatric and medical history. It is crucial to differentiate anorexia from conditions like depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, brain tumors, gastrointestinal disorders, and appetite changes due to medication use.

### Physical Complications

Anorexia nervosa can lead to a myriad of physical issues, including:

- Dental damage from vomiting
- Low blood pressure (hypotension)
- Heart rhythm irregularities (cardiac arrhythmias)
- Slowed stomach emptying (gastroparesis)
- Hormonal disruptions, particularly amenorrhea
- Electrolyte imbalances, often presenting as deficiencies
- Infertility concerns
- Dry skin and brittle hair, including the growth of fine, downy hair (lanugo)
- Peripheral nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)
- Brain shrinkage (cerebral atrophy)
- Blood disorders such as anemia, low white blood cell count (leukopenia), and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)

In women, bone density loss (osteopenia and osteoporosis) is also common due to estrogen deficiency.

### Diagnostic Criteria

The criteria for diagnosing anorexia include:

- **Low Body Weight:** A BMI of 17.5 or less, or a weight more than 15% below what is expected
- **Self-induced Weight Loss:** Tactics may include avoiding high-calorie foods, purging, excessive exercise, or using appetite suppressants
- **Distorted Body Image:** A pervasive fear of gaining weight or belief in being overweight
- **Endocrine Disruption:** Primary impact is on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to symptoms such as amenorrhea, decreased libido, increased growth hormone and cortisol levels, abnormal thyroid function, and irregular insulin secretion
- **Delayed Puberty:** If anorexia develops pre-puberty, endocrine dysfunction may delay pubertal onset

## Investigations

While the diagnosis is primarily clinical, investigations play a crucial role in identifying any physical complications. These generally include:

- Measuring weight and height for BMI calculation
- Electrocardiograms (ECGs) to check for arrhythmias, particularly prolonged QT syndrome
- A series of blood tests, typically recommended as follows:

| Test                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Full Blood Count (FBC)| Screening for blood disorders like anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia                                                                                        |
| Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) | An elevated ESR may indicate an alternate cause for weight loss |
| Urea & Electrolytes (U&Es) | Assessing for dehydration and electrolyte disturbances |
| Glucose               | Checking for low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)                                                                                                                      |
| Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs) | Identifying thyroid dysfunction |
| Endocrine Screen      | Including growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen, and progesterone levels |

## Management

### Pharmacological Approaches

The cornerstone of anorexia nervosa management is non-pharmacological, but pharmacological interventions like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine have shown benefit in some patients, particularly those with obsessive thoughts about food.

Medical management of physical complications may include:

- Calcium and vitamin D supplements for patients with osteopenia
- Hormone replacement therapy for adult women with estrogen deficiency

### Non-Pharmacological Interventions

Outpatient care is the norm for anorexia treatment, with hospital admissions reserved for severe cases. Indications for admission may include:

- Intractable weight loss not responsive to outpatient efforts
- Severe electrolyte disturbances
- Substantial bradycardia or symptomatic hypotension
- Cardiac complications
- Severe malnutrition affecting mental status
- Psychosis or suicidal risk

Hospital admission is a decision made with careful consideration of the patient's and their family's perspectives. For minors, legal frameworks like The Children Act of 1989 may apply. In life-threatening situations, The Mental Capacity Act might be invoked to authorize enforced feeding.

Psychological treatments encompass family therapy and individual therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Educational strategies include self-help resources and nutritional guidance.
