# Understanding Depressive Disorders

Depressive disorders are complex conditions that manifest as a persistent low mood, diminished interest or pleasure, and an array of additional symptoms leading to significant impairment in daily life. This article provides a clinical overview of depressive disorders, their diagnosis, and management strategies.

## Overview of Depressive Disorders

Depressive disorders encompass a range of symptoms and dysfunctions that can deeply affect an individual's social and occupational capabilities. Key characteristics include:

- Persistent low mood
- Loss of interest and enjoyment
- Neurovegetative disturbances
- Reduced energy

Clinically, depressive disorders are observed as a spectrum, with severity ranging from mild to severe. In some severe cases, individuals may experience psychotic symptoms such as paranoia, hallucinations, or significant impairment in daily function.

The origins of depression are not entirely understood but are thought to involve a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. These disorders are notably prevalent, ranking among the top causes of disability globally, with approximately 20% of primary care patients exhibiting some symptoms of depression.

Depression's pathophysiology is multifaceted and involves complex interactions between neurotransmitter systems, hormonal imbalances, inflammatory pathways, and genetic predispositions.

## Diagnosis of Depression

Diagnosing depression is primarily clinical and includes a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and mental state examination. Physical signs are not definitive but may include:

- Depressed affect
- Downcast gaze
- Psychomotor slowing
- Delayed speech
- Feelings of guilt or self-blame

Physical and cognitive examinations are instrumental in excluding conditions that mimic depression, such as hypothyroidism or dementia, and identifying co-occurring illnesses like obesity or cancer.

### Diagnostic Criteria

The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) outlines the following criteria for depression:

- **Core Symptoms:** At least two of the following, present most days and most of the time for a minimum of two weeks:
  - Low mood
  - Anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure)
  - Fatigue or low energy

Presence of core symptoms prompts further inquiry into associated symptoms:

- Disturbed sleep
- Poor concentration or indecisiveness
- Low self-confidence
- Changes in appetite
- Suicidal thoughts or behaviors
- Psychomotor changes (retardation or agitation)
- Guilt or self-blame

The diagnosis may be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the total number of features (core and associated) present: 4, 5-6, and >7, respectively. Somatic and psychotic symptoms can further refine the classification.

### Differential Diagnosis

Depression must be distinguished from several other conditions:

- General medical disorders
- Normal sadness
- Burnout
- Adjustment disorder with depressed mood
- Attention hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
- Bipolar disorder
- Borderline personality disorder
- Complicated grief
- Delirium
- Schizophrenia
- Schizoaffective disorder

## Investigations

To rule out other causes of depressive symptoms, initial laboratory tests should include:

- Thyroid function tests
- Metabolic panel
- Complete blood count
- Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels
- 24-hour urinary cortisol (elevated levels may indicate Cushing's disease)

Screening tools for depression include:

- PHQ-2 (2-item Patient Health Questionnaire)
- PHQ-9 (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire)
- MDI (Major Depression Index)
- QIDS (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology)

## Management of Depression

### Prescribing Interventions

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggests that the choice of antidepressant should consider patient preference, prior treatment experiences, and cost.

- **First-Line Treatment:** Low-dose Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, citalopram, and sertraline. The dosage may be increased as needed. Patients should be counseled that the full effect may take up to 6 weeks and that the effective dose should be maintained for at least 6 months post-recovery.
- **Second-Line Therapy:** An alternative SSRI from the first-line options.
- **Third-Line Agents:** Mirtazapine or venlafaxine.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Patients should be informed about the possibility of feeling worse immediately after starting medication before experiencing improvement.

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

- **For Mild Depression:** Suggest low-intensity psychological interventions focusing on sleep hygiene, anxiety management (e.g., mindfulness), and problem-solving techniques. Options include guided self-help, computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and structured group-based physical activity programs.
- **For Moderate Depression:** Combine high-intensity psychological interventions (e.g., 8-12 sessions of CBT or interpersonal therapy) with antidepressant medication.
- **For Severe Depression:** Consider rapid referral for specialist mental health assessment, potential inpatient admission, and treatments like electroconvulsive therapy.

    question: "A 32-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a 3-week history of persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities he used to enjoy, and fatigue. He also reports difficulty sleeping and a lack of appetite. He denies any recent life stressors or substance use. His medical history is unremarkable, and he is not on any medications. What is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?",
    options: [
      "Begin low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy",
      "Order thyroid function tests and a metabolic panel",
      "Refer the patient to a psychiatrist for immediate evaluation",
      "Advise the patient to improve sleep hygiene and reassess in 2 weeks",
      "Start the patient on a structured group-based physical activity program"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient presents with symptoms consistent with depression, including core symptoms like persistent low mood and anhedonia. Initial laboratory investigations, including thyroid function tests and a metabolic panel, are essential to exclude other causes of depressive symptoms before initiating treatment.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember to rule out organic causes that can mimic depression before starting pharmacotherapy. What tests would you order to exclude these conditions?"
  },
  {
