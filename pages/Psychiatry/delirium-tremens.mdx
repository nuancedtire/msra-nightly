# Delirium Tremens: Clinical Insights and Management

Delirium tremens (DTs) is a severe and potentially fatal condition that arises during alcohol withdrawal, characterized by rapid cognitive and attentional disturbances, often accompanied by hallucinations. Recognizing and managing DTs is crucial due to its high mortality rate without proper treatment.

## Understanding Delirium Tremens

Delirium tremens begins between 72 and 96 hours after the last alcohol intake and can persist for up to 5 days. The condition is part of a spectrum of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, with 20 percent of patients experiencing severe manifestations, including DTs. Historically, untreated DTs had a mortality rate as high as 37 percent.

### Pathophysiology

Alcohol functions as a depressant in the central nervous system, enhancing the action of inhibitory neurotransmitters and suppressing excitatory ones. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake leads to a surge in excitatory neurotransmitter activity, particularly glutamate, contributing to the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and DTs.

## Diagnosis of Delirium Tremens

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on a thorough patient history and examination, along with the criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5):

- **A.** Heavy and prolonged alcohol use followed by cessation or reduction.
- **B.** Emergence of two or more of the following symptoms post-cessation:
  - Autonomic hyperactivity
  - Increased hand tremor
  - Insomnia
  - Nausea or vomiting
  - Hallucinations or illusions
  - Psychomotor agitation
  - Anxiety
  - Generalized tonic-clonic seizures
- **C.** These symptoms cause significant distress or functional impairment.
- **D.** Symptoms are not due to another medical condition or substance-related disorder.

Risk factors supporting the diagnosis include:

- Previous DTs history
- Prior seizures
- Concurrent illnesses and comorbidities
- History of detoxification
- Time since last drink

Differential diagnoses to consider:

- Sepsis
- Encephalitis
- Meningitis
- Hyperthermia
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

## Investigative Approaches

Although DTs is diagnosed based on clinical assessment, additional tests can help confirm the diagnosis and exclude other conditions:

- Venous blood gas
- Blood glucose level
- Full blood count
- Urea and electrolytes, including magnesium and phosphate
- Liver function tests and GGT
- Coagulation profile
- CT head scan for those with seizures or altered consciousness

## Emergency Diagnosis and Management

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Delirium tremens is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to avoid a high risk of mortality.
</Callout>

Treatment-resistant cases, termed benzodiazepine-resistant delirium tremens, require transfer to intensive care for rapid tranquilization with agents like midazolam, ketamine, or propofol.

## Management Protocols

### Prescriptive Measures

- First-line treatment: Oral lorazepam
- If symptoms persist: IV lorazepam
- Antipsychotic addition (e.g., haloperidol) after adequate benzodiazepine dosing
- Phenobarbital for persistent psychotic symptoms despite other treatments

### Non-Prescriptive Measures

Monitoring and support are crucial:

- Hourly monitoring using the CIWA-Ar score for drug treatment response
- Blood glucose checks
- Vital signs monitoring with NEWS2 or similar protocols

Post-discharge:

- Use FAST or AUDIT-C tools for relapse risk assessment
- Refer to community addiction services
- Consider cognitive behavioral therapy
- Psychiatric referral for comorbid depression or anxiety

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism presents with confusion, tremors, and visual hallucinations four days after his last drink. On examination, he is agitated, diaphoretic, and hypertensive. His temperature is 38.5°C, and he has a noticeable hand tremor. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line treatment for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Oral lorazepam",
      "Intravenous haloperidol",
      "Oral olanzapine",
      "Intravenous phenobarbital",
      "Supportive care with fluids and observation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient is displaying signs of delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. First-line treatment for delirium tremens is oral lorazepam, which is a benzodiazepine effective in managing symptoms and preventing progression.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the severity of the patient's symptoms and the most effective first-line treatment for managing delirium tremens."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with delirium tremens is showing little response to initial doses of benzodiazepines. His symptoms include severe agitation and hallucinations. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",
    options: [
      "Increase frequency of vital signs monitoring using NEWS2 protocol",
      "Addition of an antipsychotic such as haloperidol",
      "Administer intravenous fluids and thiamine",
      "Transfer to intensive care for consideration of rapid tranquilization with agents like midazolam or propofol",
      "Repeat CT head scan to rule out alternative diagnoses"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Patients with delirium tremens that is resistant to benzodiazepines, indicated by persistent symptoms despite treatment, should be transferred to intensive care for rapid tranquilization with agents such as midazolam or propofol.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the severity and resistance to initial treatment when managing delirium tremens. Which intervention is indicated for benzodiazepine-resistant cases?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following patient profiles would have the highest risk for developing delirium tremens upon cessation of alcohol intake?",
    options: [
      "A 25-year-old woman with a history of binge drinking on weekends",
      "A 60-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism and multiple episodes of seizures",

      "A 45-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of alcohol use disorder starting her first detoxification",
      "A 70-year-old man with occasional alcohol use and a recent fall"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A patient with a history of chronic alcoholism and previous episodes of seizures is at higher risk for developing delirium tremens upon cessation of alcohol intake.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Recall the risk factors for developing delirium tremens after stopping alcohol intake. Consider the patient's history with alcohol and any previous complications."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with suspected delirium tremens has a significant hand tremor, is agitated, and reports seeing 'bugs on the walls'. His vital signs reveal autonomic hyperactivity.
