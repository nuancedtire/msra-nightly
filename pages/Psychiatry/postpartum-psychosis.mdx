# Postpartum Psychosis: An Overview

## Introduction

Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is a severe mental health condition that can affect women shortly after childbirth. It is characterized by symptoms typically associated with psychosis, such as:

- Delusions
- Hallucinations
- Mania
- Psychotic depression features

The disorder often manifests with changes in behavior or personality. Among the common signs are paranoia and delusions or hallucinations, particularly concerning the newborn's safety. Recognizing PPP early is critical due to the serious risk of harm it poses to both the mother and infant.

## Risk Factors

Women with a history of psychiatric conditions, especially bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia, face a heightened risk of developing PPP.

## Clinical Diagnosis

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on:

- The presence of acute psychotic symptoms in the postpartum period
- A detailed psychiatric evaluation
- A comprehensive medical and neurological examination to exclude organic causes

### Differential Diagnoses

Conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis include:

- Postpartum depression
- Depression with psychotic features
- Bipolar affective disorder
- Schizophrenia

## Investigations

While PPP is diagnosed clinically, investigations are crucial to rule out organic etiologies:

- **Basic Blood Tests**: Full blood count (FBC), Urea & Electrolytes (U&Es)
- **Haematinics**: To check for B12 and folate deficiencies
- **Thyroid Function Tests**: Essential baseline as some treatment drugs can affect thyroid function
- **Calcium Levels**: Hypercalcemia can cause neurological symptoms
- **Urinalysis**: To detect urinary tract infections (UTIs)
- **Urinary Drug Screen**: To identify potential toxins
- **Cranial Imaging (CT/MRI)**: Recommended if a neurological cause is suspected

## Management Strategies

### Pharmacological Treatment

The initial management includes medications like atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers such as lithium. The decision to continue breastfeeding while on psychotropic medication is individualized, weighing the benefits against potential risks to the infant.

**Important:** Breastfeeding is not recommended for women taking carbamazepine, clozapine, or lithium due to the risk to the infant.

### Non-Pharmacological Treatment

Given the emergency nature of PPP, inpatient psychiatric care is mandatory. The preferred setting is a specialist Mother and Baby Unit to facilitate the mother-infant bond while treating the mother's condition. Recovery may take several months to a year.

Expectant mothers with a psychiatric history should be counseled on their increased risk for PPP. Decisions regarding pre-pregnancy psychotropic medication should be individually tailored to balance the risk of discontinuation during pregnancy against the risk of PPP development.

## Conclusion

Postpartum psychosis is a critical condition requiring immediate intervention. Early identification and appropriate treatment, in conjunction with supportive care, are essential to ensure the safety and well-being of both mother and child.
