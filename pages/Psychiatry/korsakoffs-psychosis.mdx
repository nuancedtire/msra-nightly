# Understanding Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a severe neurologic condition stemming from a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1), which is particularly prevalent among individuals with alcohol use disorder. It comprises two distinct yet interrelated disorders: Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis.

## Wernicke's Encephalopathy and Korsakoff's Psychosis

### Wernicke's Encephalopathy
- **Acute neurologic disorder**
- Symptoms include:
  - Encephalopathy
  - Oculomotor dysfunction
  - Gait ataxia

### Korsakoff's Psychosis
- Late neuropsychiatric manifestation of Wernicke's encephalopathy
- Characterized by global amnesia and other neuropsychiatric symptoms
- Frequently develops in **80%** of untreated Wernicke's encephalopathy cases
- Other causes include malabsorption, poor dietary intake, and dialysis

Thiamine is crucial for pyruvate decarboxylation during metabolism. Deficiency can lead to damage in the medial thalamus, mammillary bodies, and generalized cerebral atrophy—all part of the limbic system involved in memory and emotion.

## Diagnosis of Korsakoff's Psychosis

A diagnosis is based on the presence of typical symptoms in patients with a history of severe chronic alcohol dependence. Symptoms include:

- Anterograde amnesia: inability to form new memories
- Retrograde amnesia: loss of memories prior to syndrome onset
- Amnesia of fixation: inability to remember recent events
- Confabulation: creation of false memories
- Lack of insight and apathy
- Decreased spontaneity and initiative

Attention and social behavior are typically preserved, allowing patients to engage in socially appropriate conversation.

### Risk Factors for Korsakoff's Psychosis
- Chronic alcohol abuse
- Chemotherapy
- Dialysis
- Rapid weight loss
- Low body mass index (BMI)
- Anaemia
- Pellagra

## Investigations

Although no tests confirm Korsakoff's psychosis definitively, the following can support the diagnosis:

- Full blood count, ESR, and CRP to rule out encephalitis
- Liver function tests and albumin levels due to alcohol abuse sequelae
- Neuroimaging showing cerebral atrophy, especially in the mammillary bodies and thalamus

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

Wernicke encephalopathy is a medical emergency and can be fatal in up to **20%** of cases, and leads to Korsakoff syndrome in **85%** of survivors if untreated.

**Warning:** Early recognition and treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy are crucial to prevent progression to Korsakoff's psychosis.

## Management

### Prescribing Management

- Thiamine replacement via IV or IM injection
- Ensure proper nutrition and hydration
- Administer thiamine before glucose to prevent exacerbation of symptoms

<details>
<summary>Typical Emergency Treatment Regimen</summary>

Pabrinex ® I/V High Potency in Glucose 5% or Sodium Chloride 0.9% as per the British National Formulary (BNF) guidelines:

- 2–3 pairs 3 times a day for 3–5 days
- Followed by 1 pair once daily for a further 3–5 days or until improvement continues

</details>

- Oral thiamine continuation for 3 to 12 months post-acute episode

### Non-Prescribing Management

- One-quarter of cases are reversible
- Long-term care may be necessary for some
- Referral for rehabilitation and comorbid condition treatment
- Interprofessional care team approach, including education and support

## Prevention

Preventing vitamin B/thiamine deficiency is the most effective method to avoid Korsakoff’s psychosis.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 53-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse presents to the emergency department with confusion, oculomotor dysfunction, and ataxia. The immediate management to prevent progression of his condition should include:",
    options: [
      "Intravenous glucose infusion",
      "Oral thiamine replacement",
      "Intravenous or intramuscular thiamine replacement",
      "Supportive care with hydration and nutrition alone",
      "High-dose benzodiazepines to manage alcohol withdrawal"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Intravenous or intramuscular thiamine replacement is critical in the management of suspected Wernicke's encephalopathy to prevent progression to Korsakoff's psychosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which requires immediate intervention to prevent irreversible damage. What is the first-line treatment for thiamine deficiency?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with known Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is most likely to demonstrate which of the following on a neuropsychiatric evaluation?",
    options: [
      "Improved memory recall after cues",
      "Detail-rich confabulation when recounting past events",
      "Preserved attention and appropriate social behavior",
      "Significant improvement in symptoms with only supportive care",
      "Anosognosia for motor deficits"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Patients with Korsakoff's psychosis typically have preserved attention and socially appropriate behavior despite their memory deficits.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the characteristic features of Korsakoff's psychosis, including which cognitive functions are preserved and which are impaired."
  },
  {

      "Excessive intake of dietary thiamine",
      "Dialysis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Excessive intake of dietary thiamine is not a risk factor for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome; in fact, it is a deficiency of thiamine that contributes to the condition.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While some options are established risk factors for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, one of them is actually beneficial rather than detrimental. Which option is it?"
