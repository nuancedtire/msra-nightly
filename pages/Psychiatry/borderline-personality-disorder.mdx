# Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) manifests as a marked instability in personal relationships, self-perception, emotions, and behavior, leading to significant distress or functional impairment. It is categorized under cluster B of the DSM's personality disorders classification.

## Prevalence and Comorbidity

BPD affects roughly 6% of the population and is often accompanied by various psychiatric conditions, including:

- Mood disorders
- Anxiety disorders
- Substance use disorders
- Eating disorders
- Somatoform disorders

## Etiology

The exact cause of BPD is not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a complex interplay of genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors.

## Diagnostic Criteria

A thorough psychiatric assessment is crucial for diagnosing BPD, considering co-occurring mental health issues, substance misuse, suicidality, and self-harm. The DSM-5 outlines the following criteria for BPD:

- A pervasive pattern of interpersonal, self-image, and emotional instability, along with marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood, as evidenced by five or more of the following:
  1. Affective instability
  2. Inappropriate anger
  3. Impulsivity
  4. Unstable relationships
  5. Feelings of emptiness
  6. Paranoia or dissociation
  7. Identity disturbance
  8. Abandonment fears
  9. Suicidality or self-injury

**Note:** The features of BPD can overlap with other disorders like bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, making accurate diagnosis challenging.

## Investigations

The Standardised Assessment of Personality-Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS) is a validated screening tool for BPD. Exclude organic causes, such as substance abuse or medical conditions, through selective testing (e.g., CT, MRI, urine drug tests) if personality changes appear suddenly.

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Management

- **Psychoeducation and Psychotherapy:** These are primary management strategies. Pharmacotherapy serves as an adjunct in severe cases or when psychotherapy alone is insufficient.
- **Medications:**
  - Use low-dose, second-generation antipsychotics for cognitive-perceptual symptoms (e.g., dissociation, paranoia).
  - Prescribe mood stabilizers for issues with impulsivity or behavioral control (e.g., aggression, self-injury).
  - Administer mood stabilizers for severe affective dysregulation (e.g., mood swings, anxiety, anger).

Examples of mood stabilizers for BPD include topiramate, sodium valproate, and lithium.

### Non-Prescribing Management

- **Psychoeducation:** Inform patients and their families about BPD's nature, symptoms, potential causes, progression, and treatment choices.
- **Evidence-based Psychotherapies:**
  - Mentalisation-based therapy
  - Transference-focused therapy
  - Dialectical behavior therapy
  - General psychiatric management

**Cochrane Review:** Psychotherapy is acknowledged as an effective treatment for BPD despite research limitations.
