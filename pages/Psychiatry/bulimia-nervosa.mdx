# Bulimia Nervosa: An Overview

Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a preoccupation with weight and body shape, leading to cycles of binge eating and compensatory behaviors to avoid weight gain.

## Prevalence and Demographics

- More common in **females** than males with a ratio of **3:1**.
- Median age of onset: **20 years**.

## Clinical Characteristics

- Bodyweight is generally **normal or above normal**, differentiating it from anorexia nervosa.
- Dietary restriction is often practiced between binge episodes to control weight or shape.
- A history of **co-morbid psychopathology** is common, including:
  - Anxiety disorders
  - Body dysmorphic disorder
  - Depressive disorders
  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
  - Substance use disorders

## Diagnostic Criteria

To diagnose bulimia nervosa, several core features must be identified:

- **Binge Eating**: Consuming a large amount of food (e.g., `>1000 kcal`) in a discrete period, coupled with a sense of lack of control.
- **Inappropriate Compensatory Behaviors**: Acts to prevent weight gain, such as:
  - Self-induced vomiting
  - Misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications
  - Fasting
  - Excessive exercise
- These behaviors occur **at least once a week for three months**.
- Intense concern with body weight and shape.

The typical behavior sequence starts with caloric restriction, followed by binge eating, then self-induced vomiting, which then circles back to further restriction.

## Clinical Examination and Findings

During the clinical examination, it is important to measure height and weight, calculate BMI, and compare it with normal values. Other findings may include:

- Dental erosion
- Parotid hypertrophy
- Russellâ€™s sign (scarring on the hands from induced vomiting)
- Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte abnormalities

## Investigations

There are no specific laboratory tests to diagnose bulimia nervosa, but tests are done to screen for complications:

- Full Blood Count (FBC)
- Electrolytes: Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Bicarbonate
- Liver enzymes: AST, Alkaline phosphatase
- Magnesium, Phosphorus
- Vitamin B12, RBC folate, Ferritin
- Urinalysis and Pregnancy test
- Electrocardiogram (ECG)

Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) bone density scans are not routine but may be requested for suspected bone loss.

Common renal and electrolyte complications include dehydration, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis.

## Management

### Pharmacologic Treatment

- **Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors** (SSRIs) or **serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors** (SNRIs) are the main pharmacologic agents.
- Fluoxetine is the **first-line choice**.
- Sertraline is an alternative for those intolerant to Fluoxetine.

### Non-Pharmacologic Treatment

- **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy** (CBT) is the primary treatment modality.
- Nutritional support from a registered dietitian can help normalize intake and maintain weight.
- **Interpersonal Psychotherapy** (IPT) has shown effectiveness in reducing binge-eating episodes.

**Tip:** Combining psychotherapy and nutritional support with pharmacotherapy often yields the best outcomes in treating bulimia nervosa.

    question: "A 22-year-old female college student is brought to the psychiatrist by her parents due to concerns about her eating behaviors and weight. She admits to consuming large amounts of food in secret and feeling out of control during these episodes. She also reports using laxatives and inducing vomiting to prevent weight gain. Her BMI is within the normal range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging subtype",

      "Hypokalemia",
      "Hypernatremia",
      "Respiratory alkalosis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in bulimia nervosa due to purging behaviors such as self-induced vomiting and laxative abuse.",
