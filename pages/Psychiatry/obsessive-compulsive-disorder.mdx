# Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Overview

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by distressing obsessions and/or compulsions that can significantly impact an individual's daily life and relationships.

## Understanding OCD

OCD is marked by:

- **Obsessions**: Persistent, intrusive thoughts, urges, or images causing marked distress.
- **Compulsions**: Repetitive behaviors or mental acts aimed at reducing anxiety or preventing feared events, often recognized as excessive or unrealistic.

Both elements lead to considerable distress, consume substantial time (typically more than 1 hour per day), or interfere with a person's routine, functioning, or social interactions.

### Etiology

Factors contributing to OCD include:

- **Genetic predisposition**: Increased risk among first-degree relatives.
- **Neurotransmitter influence**: Potential involvement of serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate, evidenced by the effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in treatment.

### Associated Factors

- **Pregnancy**: Increased onset of OCD symptoms during pregnancy.
- **Learning and Cognitive Theories**: 
  - Compulsions are seen as self-reinforcing due to temporary anxiety relief.
  - Obsessions may stem from catastrophic misinterpretations of thoughts or impulses.

### Clinical Impact

The road to an accurate OCD diagnosis is often prolonged, sometimes taking years. Suboptimal treatment responses can lead to significant disability and morbidity.

## Diagnostic Criteria

OCD is diagnosed using the ICD-10 or DSM-5 criteria. Key diagnostic points include:

- Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both.
- Significant distress or disruption to normal functioning.
- Symptoms not attributable to substances or other medical conditions.
- Distinct from other mental health disorders.

### Insight Levels

Patients with OCD may recognize their obsessions and compulsions as possibly or definitely not true, with varying degrees of insight.

## Investigations

- **OCD is primarily diagnosed through clinical evaluation** based on the DSM-5 criteria.
- **Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID)** may be used, especially in research, to systematically assess DSM-5 criteria for OCD.

## Management Strategies

### Non-Prescribing Approaches

- **Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)**: A scoring system that assesses symptom severity and monitors treatment response.
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: The first-line psychotherapeutic approach, particularly exposure and response prevention, tailored to each patient's symptom hierarchy.

### Prescribing Approaches

Pharmacotherapy options include:

- **Clomipramine**: A serotonin-specific tricyclic antidepressant.
- **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**: Such as fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine.

**Tip:** Medication doses may be increased after 6 to 8 weeks if necessary. Dual pharmacotherapy may be considered after 12 weeks in case of partial response or lack of improvement.

- **Antipsychotics**: Medications like haloperidol, risperidone, and aripiprazole may be beneficial, particularly for patients with limited insight.
- **Continued Treatment**: Medication use may extend for at least a year post-symptom resolution to minimize relapse risk.
