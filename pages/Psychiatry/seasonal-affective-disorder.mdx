# Understanding Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a cyclic form of depression with symptoms most commonly appearing during the winter months, leading to the alias "winter depression." Symptoms emerge at a consistent time each year, resolving completely outside of these periods. Though SAD has sparked debate regarding its classification, it is acknowledged in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) under 'recurrent depressive disorder.' Its recognition has grown, with ongoing research into effective treatments and management strategies.

## Etiology of SAD

The root cause of SAD remains elusive, but theories suggest a link to reduced sunlight exposure during winter. This can lead to:

- Decreased melatonin production
- Reduced serotonin levels
- Disrupted Circadian rhythms

These factors are believed to contribute to the onset of depressive symptoms characteristic of SAD.

## Clinical Diagnosis of SAD

### Characteristics

SAD is identified by its distinctive clinical features, which include:

- Low mood
- Anhedonia (loss of pleasure)
- Fatigue
- Sleep disturbances
- Feelings of guilt or hopelessness
- Seasonally recurrent symptoms

### Distinguishing SAD

A key differentiator for SAD is an increase in appetite, particularly for carbohydrates, which may set it apart from other forms of depression.

### Classification

SAD is listed under 'recurrent depressive disorder' in the ICD-10 and does not have a separate classification.

## Investigations for SAD

### Clinical Assessment

SAD diagnosis is primarily clinical. Nonetheless, it's critical to exclude organic causes that mimic SAD such as:

- Hypothyroidism
- Cushing's syndrome
- Addison's disease
- Hyperprolactinaemia
- Polycystic ovarian syndrome

### Laboratory Workup

Recommended baseline tests to rule out organic causes include:

- Full blood count (FBC)
- Urea and electrolytes (U&Es)
- Liver function tests (LFTs)
- Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
- Blood glucose and calcium profiles
- Haematinics

Further testing may extend to toxicology screens, comprehensive electrolyte and hormone panels, and neuroimaging or electroencephalography (EEG), especially if symptoms suggest a neurological origin.

### Making the Diagnosis

If the initial tests are normal and clinical features align with SAD, a diagnosis can be made without extensive investigations.

## Non-Pharmacological Management of SAD

### Lifestyle and Environmental Adjustments

Initial management includes:

- Maximizing natural sunlight exposure
- Regular walks or exercise during daylight
- Creating bright living and working spaces

### Diet and Exercise

A balanced diet and regular exercise are universally beneficial and particularly important in SAD management.

### Light Therapy

- Light therapy, or phototherapy, involves using lightboxes for 30 minutes to 2 hours daily.
- Maintenance therapy with lower doses is common through winter months.
- While not officially recommended by the NHS, commercial lightboxes and lamps are available.

### Psychological Interventions

Therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), counselling, and psychodynamic therapy are integral to SAD management.

## Pharmacological Management of SAD

### Medication Options

In severe SAD cases, the following may be prescribed:

- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
- Propranolol, taken before sunrise
- Melatonin or agomelatine, taken at night

**Note:** There is limited evidence supporting medication effectiveness for SAD treatment.

### Considerations

Antidepressants are reserved for severe presentations, with SSRIs being the preferred choice.

  {
    question: "A 30-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in early December with complaints of low mood, increased desire to sleep, and significant carbohydrate cravings that have recurred every winter for the past three years. She has no significant past medical history. Her physical examination and initial laboratory workup including FBC, U&Es, LFTs, TFTs, blood glucose, and calcium profiles are normal. Based on her clinical presentation, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Major depressive disorder",
      "Bipolar disorder",
      "Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)",
      "Hypothyroidism",
      "Cushing's syndrome"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's symptoms of low mood, hypersomnia, carbohydrate cravings, and the seasonal pattern of symptoms recurring each winter with resolution in other seasons are characteristic of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the temporal pattern and specific symptoms presented by the patient. Which diagnosis fits with a seasonal recurrence of depressive symptoms and increased appetite, particularly for carbohydrates?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is interested in non-pharmacological treatments. Which of the following would be the most appropriate initial recommendation?",
    options: [
      "Prescription of an SSRI",
      "Use of a lightbox for 30 minutes to 2 hours daily",
      "Initiation of propranolol therapy before sunrise",
      "Prescription of melatonin at night",
      "Referral for psychodynamic therapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Light therapy using a lightbox for 30 minutes to 2 hours daily is a well-established non-pharmacological treatment for SAD and is often used as initial management.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review non-pharmacological treatments for SAD. Which intervention is specifically related to addressing the reduced sunlight exposure thought to contribute to the disorder?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following laboratory tests is not typically included in the initial workup to rule out organic causes of symptoms resembling Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)?",
    options: [
      "Full blood count (FBC)",
      "Urea and electrolytes (U&Es)",
      "Liver function tests (LFTs)",
      "Serum prolactin",
      "Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is not typically included in the initial laboratory workup for SAD. The workup usually focuses on tests that can identify conditions such as thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and diabetes, which can present with symptoms mimicking SAD.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about which tests would be most relevant for ruling out conditions that can mimic the depressive symptoms of SAD. Which one of the options is less likely to be part of this targeted workup?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old man with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) responds poorly to light therapy and has contraindications for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Which pharmacological treatment is considered the first-line option for severe cases of SAD?",

      "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)",
      "Propranolol",
      "Melatonin",
      "Tricyclic antidepressants",
      "Monoamine oxidase inhibitors"
