# Understanding and Managing Mania

Mania is characterized by a period of unusually high energy or irritability, accompanied by at least three additional symptoms indicative of a manic state. This condition can significantly disrupt an individual's social and occupational life and may include psychotic features. Insight is often reduced, making self-awareness and recognition of the condition challenging.

Mania is a key diagnostic criterion for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD), requiring at least one manic episode along with another affective episode for a diagnosis.

## Risk Factors and Triggers

- **Non-modifiable Risk Factors:**
  - Family history of mood disorders
- **Modifiable Risk Factors:**
  - Substance abuse
- **Other Triggers:**
  - Environmental stressors

## Pathophysiology

<details>
<summary>Understanding the Brain Changes in Mania</summary>

The exact mechanisms behind mania remain largely unknown. However, MRI studies have shown that patients with bipolar disorder experience:

- **Hyperactivity in the Amygdala:** Leading to heightened emotions
- **Hypoactivity in the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex:** Resulting in impaired executive function

These functional and structural brain alterations may contribute to the clinical presentation of mania.

</details>

## Prognosis

Patients who adhere to their treatment plan generally have a favorable prognosis. However, factors associated with worse outcomes include:

- Presence of psychotic features
- Lower socioeconomic status
- History of abuse
- Early onset of the disorder

Relapse rates can be high, with up to 20% relapsing within a year and many experiencing a relapsing-remitting course.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of a manic episode requires:

- Symptoms lasting at least one week
- Significant interference with work or daily activities

**Hypomania** is a milder form:

- Symptoms persist for at least four days
- Less impact on daily life
- Preserved insight and no psychotic symptoms

**Core Symptoms of Mania:**

- Elevated mood
- Increased energy
- Heightened interest in activities

**Additional Symptoms:**

- **Cognitive:** Impaired concentration, grandiosity, lack of guilt, impulsivity
- **Biological:** Reduced need for sleep, lowered appetite, increased libido
- **Psychotic:** Hallucinations (often auditory), delusions (grandiose or persecutory)

Mental state examination may reveal rapid speech and a tendency towards a "flight of ideas."

**Bipolar Affective Disorder (BPAD):** Diagnosed when a manic episode is followed by another affective episode, such as depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed state.

## Investigations

- **Questionnaires and Scales:** PHQ-9, MDQ, CIDI, and bipolarity index
- **Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS):** Evaluates the presence and severity of mania symptoms over the past 48 hours

**Screening for Organic Causes:**

- Full blood count
- Thyroid function tests
- Serum vitamin D levels
- Toxicology screen

**Conditions Mimicking Mania:**

- Hyperthyroidism
- Substance intoxication or withdrawal

## Management (Prescribing)

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Patients experiencing acute manic episodes with impaired insight may require emergency hospitalization for their safety and the safety of others.
</Callout>

- **Acute Mania Treatment Setting:**
  - Tranquil environment
  - Verbal de-escalation
  - Medication, often via involuntary administration

**First-Line Medications for Acute Mania:**

- Aripiprazole
- Olanzapine
- Haloperidol and lorazepam as additional options

**Long-Term Medication Options:**

- **Lithium:**
  - Narrow therapeutic range
  - Monitor thyroid function every 6 months
  - Watch for lithium toxicity symptoms: tremor, hyperreflexia, polydipsia, polyuria, reduced GCS
- **Sodium Valproate:**
  - Monitor liver function
- **Atypical Antipsychotics:** Associated with weight gain, sedation, and movement disorders
  - Risperidone
  - Olanzapine
  - Quetiapine
  - Aripiprazole

*Note:* Mood stabilizers and antipsychotics can be teratogenic. Women of childbearing age should use contraception and seek specialist advice if pregnant or planning pregnancy.

**Treatment Considerations:**

- Monotherapy in hypomania or mild mania
- Combination therapy with a mood stabilizer and an atypical antipsychotic for severe mania

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Legal Measures:** Involuntary admission under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2007 if necessary
- **Psychosocial Interventions:** Aim to prevent relapse and improve social functioning

**Psychoeducation and Therapy:**

- Self-monitoring techniques
- Early warning symptom management
- Side effect management
- Stressor identification and coping strategies
- Cognitive therapy, family-focused therapy, interpersonal social therapy

**Care Management:**

- Regular psychiatric reviews to assess medication adherence and day-to-day functioning
