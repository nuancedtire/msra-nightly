# Understanding Bipolar Affective Disorder

Bipolar affective disorder, historically termed "manic depression," is a significant psychiatric condition with variable manifestations across individuals. It often involves alternating episodes of depression and elevated mood (mania or hypomania), interspersed with periods of relative normalcy. The onset of bipolar disorder typically occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood. It is a chronic condition with no specific gender or ethnic prevalence. Strong risk factors include family history, traumatic life events, concurrent psychiatric conditions, and substance misuse.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of bipolar disorder is based on criteria from the DSM and ICD classifications. The disorder is categorized into three primary types:

- **Bipolar I Disorder:** Requires at least two mood disturbance episodes, one of which must be mania or hypomania.
- **Bipolar II Disorder:** Characterized by one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode.
- **Cyclothymia:** Known for its rapid cycling between hypomanic and depressive states.

### Mania and Hypomania

A manic episode is defined by an abnormally high mood and includes at least three of the following traits:
- Elevated mood
- Increased energy
- Reduced inhibitions
- Shortened attention span
- Risk-taking behavior

Manic episodes may also involve psychotic symptoms such as grandiose or paranoid delusions and formal thought disorder (e.g., pressured speech, tangentiality, confabulation). Individuals may lose insight and become a risk to themselves or others. Hypomania, a milder form of mania, lacks psychotic symptoms, maintains relatively normal functioning, and has a shorter duration.

### Differential Diagnosis

A thorough psychiatric evaluation is essential for diagnosing bipolar disorder. Differential diagnoses to consider include:
- Psychiatric conditions: schizophrenia, personality disorders, depression
- Neurological disorders: multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, strokes, brain tumors, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease
- Endocrine disorders: thyroid disease, Cushing's syndrome
- Infections, particularly intracranial, and substance-induced mania

## Investigations

While there are no specific tests to diagnose bipolar, investigations are critical to rule out organic causes. The following tests are recommended:

- **Blood Tests:**
  - Full Blood Count (FBC): Checks for infection
  - Urea and Electrolytes (U&Es): Assesses electrolyte balance and provides treatment baselines
  - Endocrine screen and calcium profile
  - Toxicology screening, with a focus on mania

- **Urine Tests:**
  - Urine toxicology
  - Infection screening: urine samples, chest X-rays, blood cultures, lumbar punctures

- **Imaging and ECG:**
  - CT or MRI if a neurological cause is suspected
  - ECG to monitor for arrhythmias due to medication risks

## Management (Prescribing)

Medications for bipolar disorder are used in two phases: acute and prophylactic.

### Acute Phase

- **Manic Episodes:** Managed with atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine)
- **Depressive Episodes:** Treated with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or antipsychotics for augmentation, with caution to avoid precipitating mania

### Prophylactic Phase

- Initiated after remission of acute episodes to prevent recurrence
- Mood stabilizers: lithium, atypical antipsychotics, antiepileptic drugs (e.g., sodium valproate, lamotrigine)
- Start at the lowest dose and titrate up

**Warning:** Medications, particularly lithium, require close monitoring for renal and thyroid toxicity, teratogenicity, and to avoid lithium toxicity, which can have severe neurological implications.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Bipolar is a lifelong condition requiring comprehensive patient education and support. Key non-prescribing management aspects include:

- Understanding illness triggers to avoid recurrence (stress, drugs, alcohol, sleep deprivation)
- Psychological interventions during remission (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, family therapy)
- Electroconvulsive therapy for severe refractory episodes

Patients with bipolar can be vulnerable during acute episodes, warranting inpatient care for severe cases. Support groups can provide valuable assistance in coping with the disorder.
