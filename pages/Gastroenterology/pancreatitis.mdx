# Understanding Pancreatitis: Acute and Chronic

Pancreatitis is characterized by inflammation of the pancreas and can manifest as either acute or chronic. 

## Overview of Pancreatitis

### Acute Pancreatitis

This form of pancreatitis is typically a differential diagnosis for an acute abdomen, most commonly caused by gallstones or alcohol consumption. It is generally self-limiting and managed without surgical intervention.

### Chronic Pancreatitis

Chronic pancreatitis results from prolonged inflammation, potentially leading to permanent damage and functional loss of the pancreas. Management may include pancreatic enzyme supplementation and potentially surgery. Causes extend to alcohol intake, autoimmune conditions, and genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis.

### Causes of Pancreatitis

The causes are conveniently remembered by the acronym **I GET SMASHED**:

- **I**diopathic
- **G**allstones
- **E**thanol (alcohol)
- **T**rauma
- **S**teroids
- **M**umps
- **A**utoimmune disease
- **S**corpion bites
- **H**ypertriglyceridemia/Hypercalcemia
- **E**ndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
- **D**rugs (e.g., Azathioprine, Thiazides)

## Diagnosis

### Acute Pancreatitis

Diagnosis necessitates the fulfillment of two out of three criteria:

- **Clinical Presentation**: 
  - Severe, persistent abdominal pain that radiates to the back
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Possible fever
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Epigastric tenderness with guarding
  - **Grey Turner’s sign**: flank bruising
  - **Cullen’s sign**: periumbilical bruising
  - Signs of dehydration
- **Biochemistry**:
  - Elevated serum amylase or lipase levels, greater than three times the normal upper limit
- **Imaging**:
  - Ultrasonography (USS) to check for gallstones
  - Contrast-enhanced CT scan

### Chronic Pancreatitis

Since no definitive diagnostic test exists, chronic pancreatitis is identified based on:

- **Clinical Symptoms**:
  - Recurrent acute pancreatitis symptoms
  - *Steatorrhea*
  - Diabetes evidence
- **Imaging**:
  - First-line: CT or US, showing calcifications or duct dilation
  - MRI with secretin stimulation
  - Endoscopic ultrasonography

## Investigations

- **Biochemical Tests**:
  - Serum amylase or lipase >3x the normal upper limit
  - Full Blood Count (FBC), U&Es, glucose levels, LFTs (Liver Function Tests), calcium levels, C-reactive protein (CRP)
  - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) to detect hypoxia or metabolic acidosis

- **Imaging**:
  - CT with contrast for assessing necrosis and disease severity
  - USS for gallstone detection
  - MRI of the biliary tree for stones or tumors

### Additional Investigations for Chronic Pancreatitis

- Endoscopic ultrasonography
- Secretin-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
- Pancreatic function tests, such as fecal elastase levels

## Emergency Management

In cases of acute pancreatitis, immediate hospital admission is essential for supportive care, involving fluid replacement, pain management, and initially keeping the patient nil by mouth (NBM). Antibiotics may be warranted if sepsis is present.

**Warning:** Only about 20% of acute pancreatitis cases require ICU admission. Use severity scoring systems like APACHE II, Modified Glasgow, or Ranson criteria for accurate assessment.
</Callout>

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Management

- **Fluids**: Due to potential significant third-space fluid loss, high fluid intake is required.
- **Analgesia**: Adequate pain relief is crucial.
- **Antibiotic Use**: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended by current NICE guidelines.
- **Glucose Monitoring**: Regular checks and insulin administration if glucose levels rise.

### Non-Prescribing Management

#### Nutrition

- NBM status is indicated during vomiting. Transition to a low-fat soft diet as the patient improves is advisable. Severe cases may benefit from enteral feeding via NG or NJ tube.

#### Monitoring Fluid Status

- Consider catheterization for careful fluid monitoring.

#### Complication Prevention

Regular observation helps prevent complications such as **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**, **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** (heparin prophylaxis advised), infections, or pancreatic necrosis.

## Surgical Interventions

Surgery might be required for pancreatic abscesses or necrotic tissue with infection. Radiologically-guided drainage is favored for pseudocysts over surgery. **Cholecystectomy** is performed in mild cases due to gallstones.

## Chronic Pancreatitis Management

- **Lifestyle Changes**: Encourage smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and a low-fat diet.
- **Pain Management**: For unmanageable pain, consider endoscopic or surgical options, or coeliac plexus blocks.
- **Exocrine Insufficiency**: Manage with enzyme replacement therapy.
- **Endocrine Management**: Monitor and manage secondary diabetes with regular HbA1c and fasting glucose levels.
- **Complication Monitoring**: Annual DEXA scan for osteoporosis risk, and assess for pancreatic cancer.

  {
    question: "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset, severe epigastric pain that radiates to his back. He has a history of chronic alcohol use. On examination, he is tachycardic and has epigastric tenderness with guarding. Serum amylase is elevated more than three times the upper limit of normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Acute pancreatitis",
      "Chronic pancreatitis",
      "Peptic ulcer disease",
      "Cholecystitis",
      "Appendicitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient presents with classic signs of acute pancreatitis, such as acute severe abdominal pain radiating to the back and elevated serum amylase levels, especially in the context of chronic alcohol use.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the association of the symptoms with the rapid onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and a significant elevation in serum amylase levels."
  },
  {
