# Understanding Acute Mesenteric Ischaemia

Acute mesenteric ischaemia is a sudden reduction in blood supply to the intestines, caused by embolism, thrombosis, or low blood flow, which can lead to bowel ischaemia. Without prompt treatment, this condition has a high mortality rate.

## Causes of Acute Mesenteric Ischaemia

A breakdown of the common causes is shown in the table below:

Type | Percentages | Risk Factors  
---|---|---  
**Arterial embolism** | **50%** | Cardiac issues (e.g., Atrial Fibrillation (AF), post-Myocardial Infarction (MI) mural thrombosis, artificial heart valve)  
|  | Abdominal or thoracic aneurysm  
**Arterial thrombosis** | **25%** | Atherosclerosis  
**Non-occlusive disease** | **20%** | Low blood flow (e.g., recent heart surgery, heart failure, kidney failure)  
|  | Hypovolaemic and cardiogenic shock  
**Venous thrombosis** | **`< 10%`** | Younger individuals with clotting disorders, malignancy, inflammatory disorders like pancreatitis or diverticulitis, or trauma  

## Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis

Patients generally present with sudden, severe abdominal pain that is inconsistent with physical examination findings. Most patients describe a diffuse, constant pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which occurs in approximately 75% of cases.

## Investigations

### Blood Tests

- **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):** Elevated lactate and metabolic acidosis
- **Full Blood Count (FBC):** Elevated Hemoglobin (Hb) due to plasma loss, and raised White Cell Count (WCC)
- **Urea & Electrolytes (U&Es):** Evaluate kidney function focusing on urea, creatinine, and eGFR since a CT Angiography involves IV contrast
- **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** Elevated AST and ALT indicate a poor prognosis
- **Clotting Profile:** Especially when patient is on anticoagulant medication
- **Amylase Levels:** To exclude pancreatitis, although it can also be elevated in mesenteric ischaemia
- **Group & Save (G&S):** In case a blood transfusion is needed during urgent laparotomy

### Imaging

- **CT Angiography:** The gold standard for diagnosis
- **Abdominal X-Ray (AXR):** May show bowel obstruction, ileus, and in late stages, thickened bowel wall
- **Erect Chest X-Ray (CXR):** Used if bowel perforation is suspected

**Note:** Diagnosing acute mesenteric ischaemia early is challenging, but CT angiography and exploratory laparotomy offer the highest sensitivity.

## Emergency Management

Acute mesenteric ischaemia is a surgical emergency. The key life-threatening complications include:

- **Septic peritonitis**
- **Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)** leading to multi-organ failure due to bacterial translocation through the necrotic bowel wall

### Initial Management Steps

- Begin **IV fluid resuscitation**
- Administer **broad-spectrum IV antibiotics**
- Give **low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)**
- Carry out an **urgent laparotomy** to excise necrotic bowel tissue

**Mortality rates remain between 50-80%**, even with timely diagnosis and intervention. Survivors may experience short-gut syndrome.

## Management Strategies

### Acute Management (Prescribing)

- **IV fluid resuscitation**
- **Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics**
- **LMWH**

### Long-term Management

- Possible need for **lifelong anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy**

### Non-prescribing Management

- **Urgent exploratory laparotomy** to remove necrotic bowel
- **Potential bowel revascularization** attempts on viable tissue; usually complex and may require a second surgery

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department with sudden, severe diffuse abdominal pain. Her vitals show a temperature of 99°F, heart rate of 110 BPM, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20/min. Lab findings reveal elevated lactate and a high white blood cell count. What is the most likely etiology of her condition?",
    options: [
      "Arterial embolism from atrial fibrillation",
      "Arterial thrombosis due to atherosclerosis",
      "Non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia from hypovolaemia",
      "Venous thrombosis from clotting disorder"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and the patient's history of atrial fibrillation strongly suggest mesenteric ischaemia due to arterial embolism.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's history and the acute onset of symptoms. Atrial fibrillation is a strong risk factor for arterial embolism causing mesenteric ischaemia."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with suspected acute mesenteric ischemia shows elevated ALT and AST levels on a blood test. Which of the following does this finding most likely indicate?",
    options: [
      "Improved prognosis due to sufficient hepatic perfusion",
      "Decreased likelihood of bowel necrosis",
      "Chronic hepatocellular dysfunction",
      "Poor prognosis due to ongoing ischemia"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Elevated AST and ALT levels indicate a poor prognosis, suggesting advanced mesenteric ischemia with significant tissue damage.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that elevated liver enzymes in the context of acute mesenteric ischemia are typically associated with a poor prognosis rather than improvement or chronic conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "In the management of acute mesenteric ischaemia, what is the primary purpose of administering low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)?",
    options: [
      "To improve splanchnic circulation",
      "To prepare the patient for potential surgical intervention",
      "To prevent further thromboembolism",
      "To provide pain relief"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! LMWH is used to prevent further thromboembolic events in patients with acute mesenteric ischaemia.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Low-molecular-weight heparin does not primarily improve circulation or alleviate pain but is crucial in thrombosis prevention."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following imaging modalities is considered the gold standard for diagnosing acute mesenteric ischaemia?",
    options: [
      "Abdominal Ultrasound",
      "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)",
      "CT Angiography",
      "Abdominal X-Ray"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! CT Angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing acute mesenteric ischaemia due to its high sensitivity and ability to visualize blood vessels.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which imaging technique provides the best visualization of blood vessels and is commonly used in acute settings for rapid diagnosis."
