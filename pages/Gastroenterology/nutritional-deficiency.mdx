# Understanding Scurvy: A Vitamin C Deficiency Disorder

Scurvy is a medical condition that arises from a deficiency of ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C. This article explores the symptoms, affected populations, and prevention measures for this condition.

## Symptoms of Scurvy

Scurvy is characterized by a range of symptoms due to inadequate vitamin C levels, including:

- **Anemia:** A condition marked by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin.
- **Spongy Gums:** Swelling and bleeding of the gums.
- **Mucocutaneous Hemorrhages:** Bleeding that occurs in the skin and mucous membranes.
- **General Symptoms:** Patients may experience irritability and anorexia (loss of appetite).

**Note:** Scurvy is most commonly observed in infants aged between 6 and 24 months.

## Population at Risk

The condition is chiefly prevalent among infants between the ages of 6 and 24 months, as their growing bodies have increased nutritional demands.

<summary>Detailed Pathophysiology of Scurvy</summary>

Scurvy results from prolonged deficiency of vitamin C, which is crucial for the synthesis of collagen. Collagen is an essential protein for maintaining the integrity of skin, cartilage, and bones. Without adequate vitamin C, collagen production is impaired, leading to the symptoms of scurvy.

## Prevention of Scurvy

An adequate dietary intake of vitamin C is vital to prevent scurvy. Foods rich in vitamin C include:

- Citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons
- Berries, including strawberries and blackberries
- Vegetables like broccoli and bell peppers
- Tomatoes and tomato juice

## Conclusion

Understanding the causes, symptoms, and prevention strategies of scurvy is key to ensuring adequate intake of vitamin C, especially in vulnerable populations such as young infants.
