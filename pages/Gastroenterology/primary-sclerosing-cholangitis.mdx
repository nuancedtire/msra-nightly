# Understanding Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)

Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease characterized by progressive inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, leading to cholestasis (bile flow blockage), liver fibrosis, and eventually liver failure. This immune-mediated condition primarily affects middle-aged males and is frequently associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), especially Ulcerative Colitis.

## Diagnosis

**Incidence and Demographics:**
- PSC affects about 1 in 100,000 people annually.
- It predominantly occurs in middle-aged males.
- The median life expectancy for those affected is around 12 years.

**Clinical Features:**
- Most individuals are asymptomatic when diagnosed.
- Symptoms that may develop include right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, pruritus, weight loss, and fatigue.
- Physical examination might reveal hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), jaundice, weight loss, and scratch marks due to itching.

### Complications

Complications related to PSC include:

1. **Recurrent ascending cholangitis**
2. **Gallbladder polyps**
3. **Cholangiocarcinoma** (6-13% prevalence)
4. **End-stage liver disease**
5. **Metabolic bone disease**
6. **Malnutrition**

*Severity Assessment*: The severity of PSC can be gauged using the Child-Pugh Score, a clinical tool that evaluates liver disease prognosis.

## Investigations

The preferred diagnostic method for PSC is **cholangiography**, specifically Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), as recommended by the 2019 British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). **Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)** is used selectively for stent placement or cytology.

**Cholangiographic Findings:**
- A "beaded" appearance of bile ducts due to alternating multifocal strictures.

**Additional Tests:**
- **Liver Function Test (LFT):** Indicates a cholestatic pattern with elevated Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and γ-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT).
- **Abdominal ultrasound, hepatitis viral screen, and antibody tests** are necessary to rule out other causes.
- **p-ANCA antibody** is highly associated with PSC.
- **Liver biopsy** may be used for staging rather than for diagnosis.

## Emergency Management

One significant complication of PSC is **bacterial cholangitis**, driven by biliary strictures and cholestasis. Patients can present with rapidly worsening jaundice, itching, fever, and right upper quadrant pain.

**Warning:** Failure to treat bacterial cholangitis can lead to sepsis. Immediate antibiotic therapy in accordance with local guidelines and urgent biliary decompression using ERCP is crucial in severe cases.

## Management

### Pharmacological Management

Treatment mainly focuses on symptom relief:

- **Pruritus:** Use Cholestyramine (Bile Acid Sequestrant).
- **Hepatic Osteopenia:** Supplement Calcium and Vitamin D.
- **Hepatic Osteoporosis:** Bisphosphonates are first-line; consider HRT for postmenopausal women.
- **Cholangitis:** Administer antibiotics as per local protocols.
- **Malnutrition:** Supplement fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).

Routine corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are not routinely recommended due to limited efficacy, except under specialist advice when features overlap with autoimmune hepatitis or IgG4 Sclerosing Cholangitis.

*Note:* Ursodeoxycholic acid, though improving LFT results, is not routinely indicated.

### Non-Pharmacological Management

**Liver Transplant:** The only definitive treatment that offers substantial therapeutic benefit, with 10-year survival rates around 70%. Indications include severe itching, recurrent cholangitis, and End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD).

Symptomatic patients unresponsive to drugs can undergo biliary decompression through ERCP, favoring balloon dilation over stenting to lower cholangitis risk.
