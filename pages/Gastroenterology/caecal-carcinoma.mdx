# Colorectal Carcinoma: An Overview

Colorectal carcinoma ranks as the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the UK, claiming approximately 16,000 lives annually. Caecal carcinoma comprises 14% of these cases and predominantly affects individuals older than 60 years. Key risk factors include:

- **Neoplastic polyps**
- **Ulcerative colitis** and **Crohn’s disease**
- **Genetic predispositions** (Familial Adenomatous Polyposis - FAP, Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer - HNPCC)
- **Low-fiber diets** or those rich in red and processed meats
- **Alcohol consumption**
- **Smoking**
- **History of colorectal cancer**

## Diagnosis

Caecal carcinoma often remains asymptomatic in its early stages. When symptoms develop, they typically include:

- Weight loss
- Vague abdominal pain
- Malaise
- Iron deficiency anemia due to fecal occult blood loss
- Palpable mass in the right iliac fossa

Less frequent symptoms include acute appendicitis, distal ileal obstruction (commonly associated with left-sided masses), perforation, hemorrhage, or fistulas.

### TNM Staging System

Cancer staging is typically performed using the TNM system, which evaluates:

| Classification | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **Primary Tumor (T)** | |
| Tis | Carcinoma in situ |
| T1 | Invades submucosa |
| T2 | Invades muscularis propria |
| T3 | Invades subserosa or perirectal tissue |
| T4 | Invades other organs |
| **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)** | |
| N0 | No regional nodes involved |
| N1 | Metastasis to 1-3 nodes |
| N2 | Metastasis to >3 nodes |
| **Distant Metastasis (M)** | |
| M0 | No distant metastasis |
| M1 | Distant metastasis |

These classifications correspond to the following stages:

- **Stage 1**: Cancer confined to the bowel wall
- **Stage 2**: Cancer penetrates the outer layer of the bowel wall
- **Stage 3**: Cancer spreads to nearby lymph nodes
- **Stage 4**: Cancer spreads to other body parts

## Investigations

### 1. Screening in Asymptomatic Population

- **Fecal Occult Blood (FOB)**: Home testing kits every 2 years for individuals aged 60-75.
- **Colonoscopy**: Follow-up for positive FOB results.
- **Flexible Sigmoidoscopy**: One-time test for individuals in their 55th year.

### 2. Investigations in Symptomatic Patients Without Rectal Bleeding

- **FOB test**
- **Full Blood Count (FBC)**: Evaluates microcytic anemia.
- **Sigmoidoscopy or Colonoscopy**: Recommended for positive FOB and/or microcytic anemia.

### 3. Investigations in Patients With Rectal Bleeding

- **Colonoscopy with Biopsy**
- **CT Scan of Abdomen and Pelvis, X-ray or CT of Chest, MRI, PET**: Detect distant metastasis.
- **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)** and tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen CEA, CA-19.9): Monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy.

**Note:** Urgent referral is advised for patients presenting with positive fecal occult blood, aged over 40 with abdominal pain and weight loss, aged over 50 with unexplained rectal bleeding, or over 60 with iron-deficient anemia or altered bowel habits.

## Management

### Pharmacological Strategies

Adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly the FOLFOX regimen (fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin), is effective for Stage 3 disease and certain Stage 2 cases, as well as in palliative care for metastatic cases. Biological therapies (e.g., bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab) may enhance treatment response and survival rates.

### Surgical Approaches

Radical right hemicolectomy with regional lymphadenectomy and gastrointestinal tract continuity restoration by anastomosis is the preferred treatment. Laparoscopic surgery is often favored due to its comparable safety and survival outcomes to open surgery. Liver resection may be considered for patients with single-lobe metastases and no extrahepatic spread.

  {
    question: "A 66-year-old woman presents with unexplained weight loss, vague abdominal pain, and fatigue. Laboratory tests reveal iron deficiency anemia. A colonoscopy confirms the presence of a caecal mass. Which of the following risk factors is prominent in her case of colorectal carcinoma?",
    options: [
      "History of gastric ulcers",
      "Regular use of NSAIDs",
      "Smoking and low-fiber diet",
      "Daily exercise and no family history of cancer",
      "Vegan diet and abstinence from alcohol"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Smoking and a low-fiber diet are significant risk factors for colorectal carcinoma, as indicated in the article.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider lifestyle-related factors that would increase the likelihood of colorectal carcinoma."
  },
  {
    question: "A 62-year-old male with a family history of Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) undergoes a routine screening for colorectal cancer. His fecal occult blood test is positive. What is the next appropriate step in his diagnostic evaluation?",
    options: [
      "Repeat fecal occult blood test in 6 months",
      "Perform a full blood count",
      "Schedule a colonoscopy",
      "Begin empirical iron supplementation",
      "Order a CT scan of the abdomen"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A positive fecal occult blood test warrants a colonoscopy to directly visualize and potentially biopsy any colonic lesions.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the best way to directly assess and confirm the presence of colorectal lesions."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with known ulcerative colitis presents with a sudden abdominal pain, fever, and difficulty passing stool. Imaging shows a large right-sided colonic structure concerning for caecal carcinoma. If confirmed, which of the following findings on TNM staging would most likely stage this as Stage 3 colorectal cancer?",
    options: [

      "T4, N2, M0"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Stage 3 cancer indicates lymph node involvement (N1 or N2) without distant metastasis (M0).",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember to assess lymph node involvement and the absence of distant metastasis in determining Stage 3."
  },
