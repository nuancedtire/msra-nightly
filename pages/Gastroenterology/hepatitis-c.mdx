# Comprehensive Overview of Hepatitis C

## Introduction

Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the **Flaviviridae** family. It is known for causing both **acute** and **chronic** hepatitis. The acute stage is usually **self-limiting** and rarely leads to liver failure. However, a significant number of cases progress to **chronic infection**, potentially resulting in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and necessitating liver transplantation.

- **Transmission**: Predominantly through blood and bodily fluids.
- **Vaccination**: Currently, no vaccine is available for Hepatitis C.

Approximately 85–90% of asymptomatic individuals develop chronic liver disease, whereas a higher percentage of those with symptoms clear the virus.

## Extrahepatic Manifestations

HCV infection can lead to various **extrahepatic complications**, such as:

- **Arthritis**
- **Cryoglobulinemia** (with or without glomerulonephritis)
- **Porphyria cutanea tarda**
- Higher incidence of diabetes
- Associations with conditions like lichen planus, sicca syndrome, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The immune response involves **Th2 cytokines** contributing to fibrosis, promoting chronic infection. A better outcome is observed with **Th1 cytokines**, which counteract fibrosis.

## Diagnosis

### Acute Hepatitis C

Most acute HCV infections are asymptomatic, with about 10% presenting mild influenza-like symptoms, jaundice, and elevated serum aminotransferases. The majority are diagnosed only after years, often when abnormalities are discovered during health checks.

### Chronic Hepatitis C

Chronic infection is usually asymptomatic, diagnosed following routine biochemical tests revealing mild elevations in **alanine aminotransferase (ALT)** levels in about 50% of patients.

#### HCV Antibody Testing

An [HCV antibody test](https://cks.nice.org.uk/hepatitis-c#!diagnosisSub:3) is recommended for:

1. Individuals at high risk due to occupational exposure.
2. Patients exhibiting symptoms suggesting hepatitis, such as:
   - General malaise, flu-like symptoms
   - Persistent fatigue, myalgia, depression
   - Nausea, vomiting
   - Abdominal pain, jaundice
3. Elevated liver function tests with ALT levels rising significantly.

## Investigations

Key investigations include:

- **HCV RNA test** (for active infection and genotyping)
- **Full blood count** (checks for anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
- **Renal and liver function tests** (includes ALT, GGT)
- **Clotting screen**
- **HbA1c** and **Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs)**
- **Ferritin level** (indicating iron stores)
- **Hepatitis B status** and **HIV test**

## Management

### Antiviral Prescribing

Antiviral therapy should be initiated by specialists and involves:

- **Pegylated interferon alpha** and oral **ribavirin**
- Treatment varies by **HCV genotype, viral load, and liver disease severity**
- **Genotype 1** patients might require additional protease inhibitors.

Over 99% of those who achieve a sustained viral response are cured. Liver transplantation remains an option for end-stage liver disease.

### Non-Prescribing Strategies

- **Acute Infection**: Monitor HCV RNA levels; initiate interferon therapy if viral decline is absent.
- Urgent referrals to specialists for suspected cases.
- **Post-exposure Protocols**: Immediate attention to needle-stick injuries.
- **Support**: Resources such as the British Liver Trust, Hepatitis C Trust.
- **Lifestyle Advice**: Alcohol reduction, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy weight help manage disease progression.

**Warning:** Notify the local Health Protection Team of suspected acute viral hepatitis cases immediately.

  {
    question: "A 50-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presents with chronic fatigue and mild abdominal pain. Routine blood tests reveal elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. An HCV antibody test is positive. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    options: [
      "Start pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy immediately",
      "Order an HCV RNA test to confirm active infection",
      "Initiate lifestyle modifications such as alcohol reduction",
      "Monitor liver function tests every three months"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An HCV RNA test should be ordered to confirm active infection and determine the viral genotype before starting antiviral therapy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the steps required to confirm active HCV infection before initiating therapy. Which test gives definitive evidence of ongoing viral replication?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman is diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C after presenting with fatigue and mildly elevated liver enzymes. She is asymptomatic and otherwise healthy. What is the main reason for initiating antiviral therapy in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Prevention of transmission to others",
      "Symptom relief",
      "Prevention of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma",
      "Immediate eradication of the virus"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The primary goal of antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C is to prevent the progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While other options may be secondary benefits, consider the long-term complications associated with chronic HCV infection that antiviral therapy aims to prevent."
  },
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old man with hepatitis C virus infection is being assessed for treatment options. His genotyping reveals infection with HCV Genotype 1. Which additional treatment might he require to achieve a sustained viral response?",
