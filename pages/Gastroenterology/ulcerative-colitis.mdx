# Understanding Ulcerative Colitis

Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation of the colon and rectum. It presents in two main age groups: 15-25 years and 55-65 years. Being an autoimmune condition, it often coexists with other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid and Addison's diseases and is also associated with HLA-B27 positivity.

## Distinguishing Features

UC is differentiated from Crohn’s disease primarily through colonoscopy. UC is marked by a continuous spread from the rectum upwards, without the presence of skip lesions seen in Crohn’s disease.

Interestingly, smoking appears to have a protective effect against UC, making it more prevalent among ex-smokers and non-smokers. Moreover, UC is linked with primary sclerosing cholangitis, which features jaundice and a distinctive beading on the biliary tree observed in MRCP imaging.

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Presentation

- **Pain:** Lower left quadrant pain, typically crampy.
- **Diarrhea:** Frequent bowel movements.
- **Rectal bleeding:** Blood in stool.
- **Tenesmus:** Persistent feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation.

### Investigations

#### Colonoscopy
- *Inflammatory Pattern:* Starts from the rectum and extends upwards, presenting as diffuse erythema with friable submucosa that bleeds easily.
- *Confined Inflammation:* Limited to the submucosa, indicating that strictures, fistulas, and fissures are not present.
- *Pseudopolyps:* Due to widespread inflammation, pseudopolyps appear, which are normal mucosal areas surrounded by ulcerated submucosa.

#### Histology
- *Crypt Abscesses:* Neutrophils form these by invading the submucosa.
- *Goblet Cell Destruction:* Leads to mucin depletion.
- *Granulomas:* Rare in UC compared to Crohn’s disease.
  
*Barium Enemas:* Though not routine, they may show haustral loss. Prolonged disease can result in a shortened, narrowed colon—termed as a 'drainpipe' colon.

## Emergency Situations

### Toxic Megacolon

A serious UC complication, where there is colonic dilation over 6cm visible on AXR and preferably on an Abdominal CT scan for detailed complication visualization. 

**Management:**
- Initiate IV corticosteroids alongside supportive care, potentially in an ICU setting, with aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement.
- Avoid anti-motility agents such as anti-diarrheals, anticholinergics, and opioids.

**Note:** If symptoms don't improve in 72 hours, surgical options like abdominal colectomy or pan-proctocolectomy should be considered due to high perforation risks, which have substantial mortality rates.

Continuous monitoring with daily AXRs is essential for assessing the resolution of toxic megacolon.

## Treatment Approach

The treatment for UC varies based on the condition's severity. The Truelove and Witts' severity index helps stratify disease severity:

- *Mild:* Fewer than 4 stools/day with minimal blood.
- *Moderate:* 4-6 stools/day, with variable blood presence but stable condition.
- *Severe:* More than 6 bloody stools/day with systemic symptoms like fever, neutrophilia, high CRP, anemia, tachycardia.

### Mild to Moderate Disease

1. Rectal aminosalicylate, e.g., mesalazine.
2. If symptoms persist after 4 weeks, add an oral aminosalicylate.
3. Persistent symptoms after another 4 weeks, introduce oral corticosteroids.

*Corticosteroids are not recommended for maintaining remission; long-term aminosalicylates can be used instead.*

### Severe Disease

1. Hospital admission with IV steroids.
2. If no improvement after 72 hours, initiate a DMARD like azathioprine or ciclosporin.
3. Failure to improve after an additional 4 days necessitates surgical consideration.

Following severe relapses or two exacerbations within a year, prescribe oral azathioprine. Pre-treatment TMPT levels should be checked to prevent improper drug metabolism. If TMPT levels are low, oral mercaptopurine is an alternative.
