# Understanding Diverticular Disease: A Comprehensive Guide

Diverticular disease encompasses conditions involving **diverticulosis**—formation of colonic out-pouchings (diverticula), and **diverticulitis**—inflammation of these diverticula.

## Overview of Diverticula

Colonic diverticula are sacs derived from the mucosa and submucosa that protrude through the muscular space surrounding the large bowel, most commonly in the sigmoid colon (85% of cases). However, in Asian populations, these may appear in the ascending colon more frequently.

### Diverticulitis

When fecal matter obstructs the diverticula leading to infection and inflammation, it results in diverticulitis. This inflammation has several potential complications:

1. **Perforation**: Can lead to:
   - **Pericolic abscess** if infectious contents are localized to pericolic tissues.
   - **Generalized peritonitis** if the infection spreads to the peritoneum.
2. **Fistula Formation**: Occurs if adjacent structures are also damaged.
3. **Fibrosis and Bowel Obstruction**: Experiencing localized damage to the bowel wall.
4. **Hemorrhage**: If a blood vessel erodes due to inflammation.

## Diagnosis

Diverticula often remain symptomless and are present in about half of individuals over 50. If symptoms appear, they might be non-specific such as:
- **Altered bowel habits**
- **Constipation**
- **Abdominal bloating**

More severe symptoms include **left lower quadrant** or **iliac fossa, colicky pain** relieved by defecation.

### Risk Factors
- Low dietary fiber intake
- Age over 50
- Smoking
- High body mass index (BMI > 30)

### Signs of Acute Diverticulitis
- Fever
- Tenderness in the left lower quadrant
- Guarding in the left lower quadrant
- An observable mass indicating a pericolic abscess
- Pelvic tenderness noted during digital rectal examination

## Investigations

The primary diagnostic test for suspected diverticulitis is a **Full Blood Count** with a focus on white cell differential, revealing increased neutrophils. Additionally, elevated levels of non-specific inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP are observed.

For imaging, **abdominal CT** is preferred to confirm diverticular disease, although abdominal ultrasound or barium enema may be employed if CT is unavailable.

## Management of Complications

Conditions like perforation, faecal fistula, bowel obstruction, or bleeding require surgical management with varied symptoms:

- **Perforation**: Characterized by severe pain and peritonism.
- **Fistula**: Symptoms depend on the structure affected.
- **Obstruction**: Results in constipation, abdominal distension, and vomiting.
- **Hemorrhage**: Presents as rectal bleeding with potential hypovolemia and signs of anemia.

## Management Strategies

### Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Diverticulosis

- Asymptomatic cases need no intervention.
- Symptomatic cases (without infection) are treated by gradually increasing dietary fiber and ensuring adequate hydration.

### Diverticulitis Management

For cases with infection, manage with:
- **Analgesics** following the WHO ladder, avoiding those exacerbating constipation.
- Broad-spectrum oral antibiotics targeting Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. Hospitalization and IV antibiotics are warranted if fever, increased WCC, or severe symptoms persist after 72 hours of oral therapy.

### Surgical Management

Complicated diverticulitis involves surgical intervention alongside antibiotics and analgesia. Indications include:
- Perforation
- Pericolic abscess >3cm
- Fistula
- Obstruction

For acute PR bleeding, attempt **endoscopic haemostasis** first. If unsuccessful, consider **angiographic embolisation**, with surgery as a last resort.

**Warning:** Early intervention in diverticulitis is crucial to avoid severe complications. Monitor the patient's symptoms continuously.

  {
    question: "A 63-year-old male with a history of hypertension and obesity presents to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and constipation for the past 2 days. On examination, there is tenderness and guarding in the left iliac fossa. A CT scan confirms acute diverticulitis without complications. What is the most appropriate initial management strategy for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Immediate surgical intervention",
      "Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and hospitalization",
      "Increase dietary fiber intake",
      "Broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and analgesics at home",
      "Endoscopic intervention"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis can be managed with broad-spectrum oral antibiotics and analgesics, particularly when the patient is stable and presents with mild symptoms.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the appropriate management for uncomplicated diverticulitis. Surgical intervention is not required for uncomplicated cases."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following symptoms is most indicative of a fistula formation in a patient with chronic diverticular disease?",
    options: [
      "Severe rectal bleeding",
      "New onset of pneumaturia or fecaluria",
      "Persistent constipation",
      "Continuous left lower quadrant discomfort",
      "Intermittent diarrhea"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of pneumaturia (air in urine) or fecaluria (feces in urine) is indicative of a colovesical fistula, a common complication of advanced diverticular disease.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider symptoms that suggest a connection between the colon and adjacent structures. Pneumaturia or fecaluria often indicate a fistula."

      "Percutaneous drainage of an abscess"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of free air under the diaphragm suggests perforation. This necessitates immediate surgical intervention to prevent further peritoneal contamination and sepsis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the serious nature of perforation indicated by free air under the diaphragm. Surgical intervention is critical in this scenario."
