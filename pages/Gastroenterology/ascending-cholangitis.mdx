# Ascending Cholangitis: Diagnosis and Management

Ascending cholangitis is an inflammatory condition of the biliary tract, often triggered by bacterial infection from the intestine due to bile stasis. Cultures from bile in acute cases are positive in over 90%, revealing a mix of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

## Risk Factors

- **Permanent Biliary Stent:** Slightly increases the risk.
- **Intrinsic Bile Duct Obstruction:** Biliary stones are the most common cause, followed by benign and malignant strictures.
- **Extrinsic Obstruction:** Can result from:
  - Malignancies
  - Inflammatory conditions like acute pancreatitis or Mirizzi syndrome
- **Parasitic Infections:** Liver flukes (Clonorchis and Opisthorchis) and *Ascaris lumbricoides* can also lead to cholangitis.
- **Iatrogenic Causes:** Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in about 1.7% of cases.

## Diagnosis

- **Classical Presentation (Charcot’s Triad):** Fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain are present in 50-75% of patients; fever and abdominal pain alone occur in 80%.
- **Additional Symptoms:** Hypotension and altered mental status in pyogenic cholangitis.
- **Confirmation:** ERCP is effective for diagnosis and treatment in the presence of abnormal liver tests. If Charcot's triad is absent:
  - **Transabdominal Ultrasound (US):** Initial test.
  - **Further Imaging:** CT, MRCP, or EUS for bile duct dilation, stenosis, or stones.
  - **Negative ERCP/EUS:** Generally rules out ascending cholangitis.

**Diagnostic Criteria:**

- **Presence of Fever or Systemic Inflammation:** Elevated WBC count, CRP.
- **Cholestasis:** Bilirubin >= 2 mg/dL or abnormal liver function tests > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).
- **Imaging:** Suggestive of biliary dilation, stone, stent, or stenosis.

**Severity Classification:**

- **Severe:** Dysfunction in cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, renal, hepatic, or hematological systems.
- **Moderate:** Presence of at least two - abnormal WBC count, fever > 39°C, age >= 75, bilirubin >= 5 mg/dL, or hypoalbuminemia.

## Investigations

- **Full Blood Count (FBC):** Elevated WBC with neutrophil dominance.
- **Liver Function Tests:** Cholestatic pattern (elevated ALP, GGT, conjugated bilirubin).
- **Cultures:** Blood, bile, or stent cultures upon removal during ERCP.

**Imaging Techniques:**

- **Abdominal US:** Initial assessment for bile duct dilation or stones.
- **Abdominal CT:** If US is inconclusive, to check for duct dilation or strictures.
- **MRCP:** Considered if US or CT are normal.
- **ERCP:** For high suspicion of biliary obstruction; therapeutic utility.
- **EUS:** Alternative for MRCP contraindications, normal liver tests, or high complication risk from ERCP.

## Management

### Medical (Prescribing)

- **IV Hydration and Electrolyte Correction**
- **Pain Relief**
- **Antibiotic Therapy:**
  - **Empirical Treatment:** Based on infection origin - community-acquired vs. healthcare-associated.
  - **Targeted Therapy:** Post-culture results.
  - **Duration:** 4-5 days post-infection control.
  - *Outcome:* 70-80% response to antibiotics.

### Procedural (Non-prescribing)

- **Monitoring for Septic Shock/Organ Dysfunction**
- **Drainage:**
  - **Timing:** Within 24-48 hours based on response and severity.
  - **Gold Standard - ERCP:** Stone extraction and stenting.
  - **Alternate Methods:** EUS-guided or percutaneous/surgical if ERCP is unfeasible.
- **Elective Cholecystectomy:** Advised post-recovery from gallstone-related cholangitis to prevent recurrence.

**Warning:** Continuous monitoring of vital signs is crucial during procedures.

  {
    question: "A 62-year-old man presents with fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. His medical history includes gallstones. Laboratory tests reveal elevated WBC count, bilirubin level of 3.2 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests. Which imaging modality is initially preferred to confirm the diagnosis of ascending cholangitis?",
    options: [
      "Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)",
      "Abdominal ultrasound (US)",
      "Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)",
      "Computed tomography (CT) scan",
      "Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Abdominal ultrasound (US) is the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluating ascending cholangitis due to its availability and non-invasive nature.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the most accessible and non-invasive imaging technique to begin the evaluation of biliary dilation or stones."
  },
  {
    question: "A 48-year-old woman with a previous biliary stent placement presents with symptoms of fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Blood cultures are pending. What is the most likely etiological agent to be isolated from bile cultures in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Escherichia coli",
      "Enterococcus faecalis",
      "Klebsiella pneumoniae",
      "Staphylococcus aureus",
      "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Escherichia coli is the most common organism isolated in cases of ascending cholangitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the most prevalent gram-negative bacteria found in biliary infections."
  },
  {
    question: "A 70-year-old patient with severe ascending cholangitis presents with signs of renal dysfunction and hypotension. Which of the following would classify this episode as 'severe' according to the severity classification criteria?",

      "Bilirubin level of 5 mg/dL",
      "Age over 75 years",
      "Presence of cardiovascular and renal dysfunction",
      "Hypoalbuminemia"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Dysfunction affecting cardiovascular and renal systems is consistent with severe ascending cholangitis classification.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the combination of multiple organ system dysfunctions as a hallmark of severe cholangitis."
  },
  {
    question: "A 55-year-old male with suspected cholangitis and biliary obstruction is non-responsive to IV antibiotics and supportive treatment. Which procedural intervention should be prioritized for therapeutic drainage?",
