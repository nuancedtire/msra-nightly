# Managing Helicobacter pylori Infections

As a patient with a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) positive gastric ulcer and no known allergies, the recommended treatment is **triple therapy**. This approach includes medications such as **omeprazole**, **clarithromycin**, and either **amoxicillin** or **metronidazole**.

## Overall Explanation

**Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)** is a spiral-shaped, microaerophilic gram-negative bacterium predominantly found in the stomach. It is one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide, affecting nearly half of the global population. Despite its prevalence, most individuals remain asymptomatic. However, H. pylori is linked to several conditions, including peptic ulcers, chronic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The reasons why only some individuals develop these complications remain unclear.

### Diagnosis

Most patients with chronic gastritis or duodenal inflammation due to H. pylori infection do not display symptoms. However, peptic ulcers can emerge, presenting various symptoms, including:

- **Epigastric pain or discomfort** associated with meals
- **Bloating**
- **Nausea/Vomiting**
- **Early satiety**
- **Loss of appetite**
- **Fatigue** (indicative of bleeding ulcers)
- **Dark stools** (indicative of bleeding ulcers)

In rare cases, chronic gastritis may lead to certain types of cancer due to changes in the stomach lining. Hence, recognizing red flag symptoms is crucial:

- **Unexpected weight loss**
- **Lymphadenopathy** (notably left supraclavicular, periumbilical, or left axillary)

### Investigations

Diagnostic tests for H. pylori are primarily suggested for symptomatic patients with active or past peptic ulcer history. Testing is usually not recommended for asymptomatic patients unless they have a higher risk of stomach cancer (e.g., due to family history).

Common investigations include:

- **Urea Breath Tests**: Involves ingesting a solution that H. pylori metabolizes, with the by-products detectable in the breath.
- **Stool Antigen Test**: Detects H. pylori proteins in stool samples.
- **Blood Tests**: Identifies specific antibodies to H. pylori, though their accuracy is questionable.

**Note:** No diagnostic test for H. pylori is 100% sensitive, and additional testing may be required if ulcers are found in patients with negative initial results.

Following treatment, retesting is usually performed to confirm the infection's resolution.

### Management (Prescribing)

**Triple therapy** serves as the primary treatment option, comprising:

- **Proton Pump Inhibitor** (PPI) – options like omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, or esoprazole.
- **Antibiotic 1** – clarithromycin.
- **Antibiotic 2** – either amoxicillin or metronidazole.

For patients with penicillin allergies, **metronidazole** replaces amoxicillin. If patients have previously undergone macrolide treatment (such as clarithromycin), **quadruple therapy** is advised.

**Alternative first-line oral therapy for 7 days** (for patients previously treated with [clarithromycin](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/clarithromycin/)):

- **Proton Pump Inhibitor** – omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, or esoprazole
- **Bismuth Subsalicylate**
- **Antibiotic 1** – metronidazole
- **Antibiotic 2** – tetracycline

**Note:**
To ensure treatment effectiveness, complete the full medication course. About 50% of patients may experience treatment side effects, which are usually mild and manageable by adjusting doses or medication schedules.

Common side effects include:

- Diarrhea and stomach cramps
- Metallic taste in the mouth (Metronidazole)
- Headaches, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and tachycardia (Metronidazole with alcohol)
- Constipation and darkened stool (Bismuth)

Patients with H. pylori-related stomach cancers may require varied chemoradiation treatments based on tumor spread and surgical intervention viability.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

Lifestyle changes are crucial for those with peptic ulcers, particularly **smoking cessation** and reducing excessive **alcohol intake** to prevent recurrence.

In cases of stomach cancer resulting from H. pylori infections, treatment options include surgery based on tumor spread. **Tumor resection** is considered for early localized disease, while more advanced cases might necessitate a **gastrectomy**.
