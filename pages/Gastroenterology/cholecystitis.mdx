# Understanding Cholecystitis: Diagnosis, Management, and Complications

## Introduction

**Cholecystitis** refers to the inflammation of the gallbladder, often resulting from a gallstone obstructing the neck of the gallbladder or the cystic duct, preventing proper drainage. Less commonly, this can be due to tumors or parasitic worms. The gallbladder secretes more bile in an effort to clear this obstruction, leading to inflammation, distension, and potentially compromised blood supply. Symptoms include right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and fever. Infection may follow, particularly in elderly or diabetic patients, caused commonly by bacteria such as *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Pseudomonas*, *Enterococcus*, and *Bacteroides fragilis*.

## Diagnosis

The risk factors for developing cholecystitis align with those for gallstones:

- **Age:** Increasing age heightens risk.
- **Gender:** More common in females.
- **Pregnancy**
- **Diet and Weight:** Obesity and high-fat diets.
- **Diabetes**

### Clinical Features

Key symptoms include:

- **RUQ Pain:** May radiate to the right shoulder.
- **Fever**
- **Nausea and Anorexia**
- Up to 10% of patients may exhibit jaundice; vomiting is a less common symptom.

### Physical Examination

Consider the following signs:

- **Murphy’s Sign:** Pain and interruption of breath upon deep inhalation while pressing the RUQ.
- **Tenderness and Guarding:** Observed in the RUQ.
- In up to 30% of cases, a palpable mass may be noted in the RUQ.

## Investigations

- **Basic Observations:** Includes respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen saturation.
- **Blood Tests:**
  - **FBC:** Possible leukocytosis.
  - **CRP:** May be elevated.
  - **LFTs:** Elevated bilirubin, ALT, ALP, and GGT.
  - **Amylase/Lipase:** To rule out pancreatitis.
- **Imaging:**
  - **Abdominal Ultrasound (USS):** Can show gallbladder wall thickening, distension, and gallstones.
  - **CT Abdomen:** Used if sepsis or gallbladder perforation is suspected.

## Emergencies in Cholecystitis

### Sepsis

**Sepsis** may arise from bacterial infection or necrosis due to inflammation. Look for acute illness or deteriorating observations. Administer intravenous antibiotics as per local guidelines in conjunction with standard cholecystitis management. Implement the Sepsis Six bundle and consider ICU referral if needed.

<summary>Complications and Management</summary>

- **Mirizzi’s Syndrome:** Caused by an impacted gallstone leading to common hepatic duct compression, resulting in obstructive jaundice. Diagnosed via USS or MRCP, requiring cholecystectomy.
- **Gallbladder Perforation:** A serious condition with high mortality, prevalent in the elderly or those with comorbidities (e.g., diabetes). Initial treatment includes IV antibiotics, fluids, and possible percutaneous cholecystotomy. Cholecystectomy follows when the patient stabilizes.
- **Gallbladder Empyema:** Characterized by gallbladder pus accumulation. Presents similarly to cholecystitis and best visualized on MRI. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred; percutaneous drainage may be necessary for unfit patients.

## Management

### Prescribing

To address pain, begin with paracetamol and NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) if appropriate, progressing to strong opioids (e.g., morphine) if necessary. Administer anti-emetics like cyclizine to combat nausea. Patients should be nil-by-mouth; hence IV fluids are required to prevent dehydration.

Administer IV antibiotics if an infection is suspected, adhering to local protocols.

### Non-Prescribing

Patients should remain nil-by-mouth to allow gallbladder rest. The definitive treatment is **laparoscopic cholecystectomy**, ideally within a week per NICE guidelines, or six weeks post-symptoms if immediate surgery isn't feasible. For those unfit for surgery due to underlying health issues, a percutaneous cholecystotomy can serve as an alternative.

**Note:** Always consult local guidelines for antibiotic protocols and escalate care if sepsis is suspected.

  {
    question: "A 62-year-old obese female presents with a 24-hour history of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea. On examination, she exhibits a positive Murphy’s sign. Laboratory tests reveal leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. What is the most likely underlying cause of her condition?",
    options: [
      "Gallstone obstructing the common bile duct",
      "Tumor in the pancreatic head",
      "Gallstone obstruction of the neck of the gallbladder",
      "Chronic ethanol abuse",
      "Congenital biliary atresia"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The clinical presentation is consistent with acute cholecystitis, often caused by gallstone obstruction at the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, preventing bile drainage and leading to inflammation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the symptoms of RUQ pain, fever, and the positive Murphy's sign, which are typical for cholecystitis rather than common bile duct obstruction or other conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "A 75-year-old male with a history of diabetes presents with acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and confusion. Imaging shows thickened gallbladder walls and fluid around the gallbladder. Which complication should be most urgently considered?",
    options: [
      "Gallbladder empyema",
      "Cholangitis",
      "Gallbladder perforation",
      "Mirizzi’s syndrome",
      "Pancreatitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Gallbladder perforation is a severe complication, especially common in elderly and diabetic patients with acute cholecystitis, requiring prompt medical attention and possibly surgical intervention.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While other complications could arise from acute cholecystitis, the combination of systemic symptoms and imaging findings is most suggestive of perforation."
