# Cardiac Tamponade

The heart is surrounded by a fibrous casing called the **pericardial sac**. In between these two structures lies a potential space, the **pericardial space**. Cardiac tamponade is caused by the accumulation of blood, fluid, pus, clots, or gas in this space. Pressure on the ventricle will reduce ventricular filling and can be a life-threatening medical emergency.

## Diagnosis

Cardiac tamponade is extremely rare but vital not to miss. Estimates vary; however, there are around 2 cases per 10,000 of the United States population. Tamponade resulting from trauma or HIV is more common in younger age groups, while those related to malignancy or chronic kidney disease occur more frequently in the elderly.

### Causes of Cardiac Tamponade

Causes of cardiac tamponade include:

- **Pericarditis**
  - Related to malignancy, particularly proximal tumors such as breast or lung cancer.
  - Acute myocardial infarction and post-infarction pericarditis (Dressler’s syndrome).
  - Infective: viral including HIV, bacterial including tuberculosis, fungal infection.
  - Connective tissue disease: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis.
  - Radiotherapy.
  - Myxoedema (hypothyroidism).
  - Chronic kidney disease.
  - Post-operative hemorrhagic pericarditis.
  - Idiopathic.
  
- **Drugs**: Hydralazine, isoniazid, minoxidil.

- **Diagnostic procedures** with cardiac perforation.

- **Trauma**: 2% incidence in penetrating trauma. Rare but possible in blunt trauma.

- **Surgery**.

- **Aortic dissection**.

### Symptoms

May be subacute presentation with:

- Anxiety.
- Fatigue.
- Oedema.
- Confusion.

Common acute symptoms include:

- Dyspnoea.
- Tachycardia.
- Tachypnoea.
- Extremities may be cold from compromised perfusion.
- May be associated with features of pericarditis.

### Signs

- **Beck's triad** (late sign and rarely seen all together):
  - Hypotension.
  - Muffled heart sounds.
  - Distended neck veins.
  
- Tachycardia, tachypnoea, hepatomegaly.
- May be a pericardial rub.
- **Pulsus paradoxus**: decrease in systemic blood pressure during inspiration. A decrease greater than `10 mmHg` differentiates patients with pericardial effusion, with or without a tamponade.
- JVP: **y descent** abolished due to increased intrapericardial pressure, which prevents diastolic filling of ventricles.
- Cyanosis and pulmonary oedema.

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies Related to this Condition

### Investigations

1. **Blood Tests**:
   - Creatine kinase (elevated in cardiac trauma).
   - Renal function tests.
   - FBC (for infection).
   - Antinuclear antibody, ESR, rheumatoid factors for possible connective tissue disorder.
   - **HIV** and **Acid-Fast Bacilli** testing.

2. **ECG**:
   - Sinus tachycardia.
   - Low voltage QRS complexes.
   - PR depression could be seen.

3. **Chest X-Ray**:
   - Cardiomegaly.
   - 'Bottle-shaped' heart.
   - Pericardial calcifications.
   - Evidence of trauma (e.g., broken ribs).

4. **Transthoracic echocardiogram** may show reduced ventricular filling.

5. **Pericardiocentesis**: aspirate sent for culture and cytology.

## Management

Patients should be moved to an intensive care unit. **Echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis** is the treatment of choice to remove pericardial fluid. It may be hazardous and may not relieve symptoms in certain cases. In trauma, **thoracotomy** may be required to stop the bleeding. Treatment of the underlying cause may be crucial.

### Primary Survey

1. Airway, breathing, circulation.
2. **Oxygen**.
3. Small volumes of fluid to maintain intravascular volume. Blood if traumatic.
4. Improve venous return with leg elevation.
5. **Positive inotropic drugs**, e.g., Dobutamine.
6. **Positive-pressure mechanical ventilation** should be avoided to maintain venous return.

### Surgical Management

- **Pericardiodesis**: for recurrent pericardial effusion or tamponade. A catheter instils drugs via an intrapericardial catheter such as corticosteroids, tetracycline, or antineoplastic drugs.
  
- **Pericardio-peritoneal shunt** may prevent recurrent tamponade in patients with malignant pericardial effusions.

- **Pericardiectomy**: Resection of pericardium is rarely required.

**Warning:** Immediate medical intervention is critical for suspected cardiac tamponade. Delayed treatment can result in significant morbidity or mortality.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old male presents with respiratory distress and signs of hypotension. Upon examination, his neck veins are distended, and heart sounds are muffled. ECG shows sinus tachycardia and low voltage QRS complexes. Which of the following findings would most likely confirm a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade?",
    options: [
      "Presence of a pericardial rub",
      "Elevated troponin levels",
      "Flat neck veins on examination",
      "Abnormal echocardiogram showing diastolic filling defects",
      "Chest X-ray showing a 'bottle-shaped' heart"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An abnormal echocardiogram showing diastolic filling defects is indicative of cardiac tamponade due to the pressure from fluid accumulation. The other options may present in different conditions or are not specific enough for cardiac tamponade.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the typical investigations used in diagnosing cardiac tamponade. Consider how imaging techniques like echocardiography can reveal hemodynamic changes in the heart as a direct result of pericardial fluid buildup."
