# Understanding Angina Pectoris: Diagnosis and Management

## Introduction

**Angina pectoris** is a condition characterized by chest pain due to insufficient blood flow through narrowed coronary arteries. It manifests in two forms:

- **Stable Angina:** Pain occurs during exertion and alleviates with rest.
- **Unstable Angina:** Pain occurs at rest and may persist, marking a medical emergency known as Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).

While stable angina is not immediately life-threatening, it can progress to unstable angina and requires thorough evaluation and treatment.

## Diagnosis

### Epidemiology

- Approximately `8%` of men and `3%` of women experience angina.
- Prevalence increases with age in both genders.
- In the UK, individuals of South Asian descent have a higher risk of ischemic heart disease, while those of Afro-Caribbean descent have a lower risk.
- Lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of angina across both sexes.

### Risk Factors

- Family history
- Male gender
- Increasing age
- Smoking
- Diabetes mellitus
- Metabolic syndrome
- Hyperlipidemia
- Hypertension
- Obesity
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Poor diet

### Clinical History

- Personal history of angina or ACS
- Previous coronary interventions, such as stent insertion or Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)
- Cardiac abnormalities like aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

### Symptoms

- **Common Symptoms:**
  - Central 'tight' or 'crushing' chest pain
  - Radiation of pain to the jaw, arm, shoulders, or neck

- **ACS/Unstable Angina Symptoms:**
  - Clamminess and sweating
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Palpitations
  - Persistent pain despite rest or medication
  - Prolonged pain (`>15 minutes`)

*Note:* Pain in stable angina may be relieved by sublingual Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN) spray, a vasodilator that can sharply lower blood pressure.

### Prinzmetal Angina

- Occurs at rest with a circadian pattern, often in the early morning.
- Caused by coronary artery vasospasm.
- Triggers include smoking, emotional stress, and cocaine use.
- Management focuses on lifestyle changes and anxiety reduction.

### Silent Myocardial Infarction

- Occurs in elderly patients or those with diabetic neuropathy who do not experience typical chest pain during ischemic events.

## Investigations

### Blood Tests

- **Full Blood Count (FBC):** Rules out anemia.
- **Renal Function Tests:** Assess electrolytes.
- **Fasting Blood Glucose or HbA1c:** Screen for undiagnosed diabetes.
- **Lipid Profile:** Includes cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis may cause chest pain and palpitations.
- **Liver Function Tests:** Baseline before starting statins.
- **Troponin T:** Cardiac enzyme indicating myocardial distress. Check `4 hours` after initial pain; repeat tests may be needed to track enzyme levels.

### Imaging

- **12 Lead ECG:** May show normal results, sinus tachycardia, or ischemic changes such as:
  - Pathological Q waves
  - Left bundle branch block
  - ST elevation/depression
  - T wave flattening or inversion
- **Echocardiography:** Assesses cardiac function, especially if hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis is suspected.
- **Coronary Angiography**

### Scoring

Upon diagnosing unstable angina, use the **GRACE score** to assess ACS risk. It factors in clinical history, physical exams, ECG, and blood tests. 

- **High or Medium Risk:** Offer early in-hospital coronary angiography with a possible GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor.
- **Low Risk or Recurring Symptoms:** Consider angiography.
- **TIMI Score:** An alternative for risk assessment.

## Management

### Prescribing

#### Short Term

- **Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN):** Refer to the Diagnosis section.
- **MONAC Protocol for ACS:**
  - Morphine (plus metoclopramide)
  - Oxygen (titrate `94-98%`)
  - Nitrate (if not already administered to maximum tolerance)
  - Aspirin `300mg` (crushed under the tongue)
  - Clopidogrel `300mg` (or per local guidelines)

- **Antithrombin Therapy:** For NSTEMI/unstable angina to reduce thrombus-related events.
  - Offer fondaparinux unless high bleeding risk or angiography is planned within `24 hours`.
  - Consider unfractionated heparin if angiography is imminent.

#### Long Term

- **Blood Pressure Control:** With antihypertensives.
- **Cholesterol Management:** With statins.
- **Beta-blockers:** Improve outcomes and reduce attack severity.
- **GTN or Oral Nitrates**
- **Aspirin**
- **Dual/Triple Antiplatelet Therapy:** Post-stenting, as prescribed by a cardiologist.

### Non-Prescribing

#### Short Term

- Urgent hospital assessment for ACS symptoms.
- Discuss unstable angina, ECG-confirmed STEMI, or NSTEMI with cardiology for potential urgent coronary angiography and PCI.
- If PCI is unsuccessful or not feasible, consider CABG.
- Urgent referral to a Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic within `two weeks`.

#### Long Term

- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Diet, exercise, smoking cessation, glycemic control, and stress management.
- **Cardiac Rehabilitation and Discharge Planning**
- *Driving Restrictions:* Cease driving for `4 weeks` post-ACS, no need to inform DVLA.
