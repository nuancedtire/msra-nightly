# Angina Pectoris: Diagnosis and Management

## Overview of Angina Pectoris

Angina pectoris encompasses two conditions related to cardiac chest pain related to insufficient blood supply through narrowed coronary arteries. The two types of angina include:

- **Stable Angina**: 
  - Chest pain occurs during exertion and dissipates with rest.
  
- **Unstable Angina**: 
  - Chest pain occurs at rest and may be persistent, representing a medical emergency and is classified as an **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**.

**Note:** Unstable angina requires immediate investigation and treatment, while stable angina, although not an emergency, may progress to unstable angina.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Unstable angina can lead to myocardial infarction if not addressed promptly.
</Callout>

## Diagnosis

**Prevalence:**
- **8%** of men and **3%** of women currently have or have previously had angina.
- Risk increases with age, with higher prevalence in:
  - South Asian origins (increased risk of ischaemic heart disease).
  - Lower socio-economic groups.

### Medical History

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Family history
  - Male gender
  - Increasing age
  - Smoking
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Metabolic syndrome
  - Hyperlipidaemia
  - Hypertension
  - Obesity
  - Sedentary lifestyle
  - Poor diet

- **Personal History**:
  - History of angina or ACS
  - Previous coronary interventions (e.g., stent insertion, CABG)
  
- **Cardiac Abnormalities**:
  - Aortic stenosis
  - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

### Signs and Symptoms

<details>
<summary>Common Signs and Symptoms</summary>

- **Chest Pain**:
  - Central 'tight' or 'crushing' chest pain
  - Radiation to jaw, arm, shoulders, neck

- **Features of Unstable Angina**:
  - Clamminess and sweatiness
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Palpitations
  - Pain increasing despite rest or medical therapy
  - Prolonged anginal pain (`>15 minutes`)

</details>

### Special Types of Angina

#### **Prinzmetal Angina**

Occurs at rest, often in the early hours, due to coronary artery vasospasm. Contributing factors include:

- Smoking
- Emotional stress
- Cocaine use

Management focuses on lifestyle modifications and anxiety management.

#### **Silent Myocardial Infarction**

Typically observed in elderly patients or those with diabetic neuropathy, who may not experience chest pain despite ischaemic events.

## Investigations

### Blood Tests

- **Full Blood Count (FBC)**: Excludes anaemia
- **Renal Function Tests**: Assess electrolytes
- **Diabetes Screening**: Fasting blood glucose or HbA1c
- **Lipid Profile**: Fasting blood cholesterol and triglycerides; ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol
- **Thyroid Function Tests**: Rule out hyperthyroidism causing palpitations or chest discomfort
- **Troponin T**: 
  - Cardiac enzyme indicative of myocardial distress, typically taken `4 hours` after initial chest pain
  - Repeat troponins may be necessary to monitor levels.

### Imaging

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
  - May appear normal or show ischaemic changes (e.g., pathological Q waves, left bundle branch block, ST elevation/depression)
  
- **Echocardiography**:
  - Assess cardiac function if hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis is suspected.

- **Coronary Angiography**: To visualize coronary arteries.

### Scoring

Upon diagnosis of unstable angina, implement the **GRACE score** to assess the risk of morbidity and mortality in ACS. Refer patients scoring medium to high-risk for early in-hospital coronary angiography. 

| Score Type              | Consideration                                    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **GRACE score**        | Clinical history, physical examination, ECG, and blood tests |
| **TIMI score**         | Can be used to evaluate thrombotic risk in ACS |

## Management (Prescribing)

### Short-term Treatment

- **Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN)**: As outlined in the Diagnosis section.

If ACS is confirmed, follow the most up-to-date protocols.

### **MONAC Protocol**:

- **Morphine** (with metoclopramide)
- **Oxygen**: Titrate to maintain SpO2 between `94-98%`
- **Nitrate**: Administer if not already given (to the max tolerated dose)
- **Aspirin 300mg**: Crushed under the tongue
- **Clopidogrel 300mg**: Or follow local guidelines

Antithrombin therapy is indicated in NSTEMI/unstable angina cases. Offer:

- **Fondaparinux**: For patients without high bleeding risk unless angiography is planned within `24 hours`.
- **Unfractionated Heparin**: As an alternative if angiography is within `24 hours`.

### Long-Term Management

- **Blood Pressure Control**: Use antihypertensives
- **Cholesterol Management**: Statins
- **Beta-blockers**: Enhance outcome and reduce attack severity
- **GTN** or **oral nitrates**
- **Aspirin**: Daily
- **Dual or Triple Antiplatelet Therapy**: May be required post-stenting, prescribed by a cardiologist.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Short-term Strategy

- Urgent hospital assessment for any ACS symptoms.
- Consult with cardiology if unstable angina or STEMI/NSTEMI is confirmed; may require coronary angiography or CABG if PCI is unsuccessful.

### Long-term Strategy

- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Diet, exercise, blood pressure management, smoking cessation
- **Cardiac Rehabilitation**: Including stress management
- **Driving Regulations**: Patients may need to stop driving for `4 weeks` post-ACS but do not need to inform the DVLA.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a history of chest pain that occurs during physical exertion and resolves with rest. His vital signs are stable, and initial ECG shows no abnormalities. What would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient’s suspected stable angina?",
    options: [
      "Immediate coronary angiography",
      "Prescribe glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) for symptomatic relief",
      "Perform a cardiac stress test",
      "Start a beta-blocker without further testing",
      "Order a chest X-ray to rule out other causes"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) can provide immediate symptomatic relief for patients experiencing angina. While a cardiac stress test is typically used in a workup for stable angina, giving GTN can help mitigate acute symptoms during the assessment process.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the patient's stable condition and the nature of his symptoms. Immediate invasive procedures or extensive testing may not be necessary at this stage. What could provide immediate relief while further evaluation is conducted?"
