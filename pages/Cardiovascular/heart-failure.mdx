# Heart Failure: Diagnosis and Management

Heart failure is characterized by the heart's inability to meet the body's metabolic demands or elevated intracardiac pressures due to structural or functional issues. It affects approximately `1-3%` of the adult population in developed nations and over `10%` of those `>70 years`. Heart failure can manifest as acute or chronic and is classified based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into two major categories: 

- **Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF):** LVEF `<40%`
- **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF):** LVEF `≥50%`

## Diagnosis

The symptoms and signs of heart failure are generally non-specific, making differential diagnosis challenging. Objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction at rest is essential for diagnosis.

### Framingham Criteria

The Framingham criteria, a diagnostic tool for heart failure (HF), requires either `2` major criteria or `1` major and `2` minor criteria:

| Major Criteria                            | Minor Criteria                   |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Acute pulmonary oedema                    | Ankle oedema                     |
| Cardiomegaly                              | Dyspnoea on exertion             |
| Hepatojugular reflux                      | Hepatomegaly                     |
| Neck vein distention                      | Nocturnal cough                  |
| Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea or orthopnoea| Pleural effusion                 |
| Pulmonary rales                           | Tachycardia (`HR >120`)          |
| Third heart sound (S3 gallop rhythm)      |                                  |
| Weight loss >4.5 kg in 5 days due to treatment |                               |

### NYHA Functional Classification

1. **Class I:** Confirmed HF with no symptoms during regular activities.
2. **Class II:** Mild symptoms during regular activities, slight decrease in exercise tolerance.
3. **Class III:** Severe symptoms limiting activities but comfortable at rest.
4. **Class IV:** Severe limitations with symptoms even at rest.

## Investigations

- **Clinical History and Physical Examination:** Initial steps, followed by an ECG. If abnormalities are found, order serum natriuretic peptides (or echocardiography if unavailable).
- **Referral:** Patients with NT‑proBNP levels between `400` and `2,000 ng/litre` should have specialist evaluation and transthoracic echocardiography within six weeks. Normal levels make HF unlikely.
- **Echocardiography:** Determines the cause of heart failure and assesses LVEF.
- **Additional Tests:** May include FBC, U&E, stress ECHO, CXR, CMR, or endomyocardial biopsy.

## Emergency Diagnosis and Management

Acute heart failure, characterized by new or worsening HF symptoms, demands immediate diagnosis and treatment. It can be triggered by factors such as acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, metabolic disorders, hypertension, drugs, or pulmonary embolism. Patients may present with cardiogenic shock or respiratory failure, necessitating circulatory and ventilator support. Specific treatments depend on the cause.

## Management (Prescribing)

Identify and treat the underlying cause of HF and manage comorbidities when feasible.

### Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (`LVEF <40%`)

- **ACE Inhibitors (ACEI):** Recommended for all symptomatic patients to reduce mortality and morbidity.
- **Beta-blockers:** For all symptomatic, stable patients; start low and gradually increase to the maximum tolerated dose. If ACEI is not tolerated, ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers) can be used.
- **Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRAs):** For patients still symptomatic despite maximum ACEI and beta-blocker doses.
- **ARNI (Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitors):** Consider for those symptomatic on ACEI, beta-blocker, and MR antagonist regimen.
- **Ivabradine:** For resistant symptoms with sinus rhythm `≥70 bpm`.
- **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT):** For patients with sinus rhythm and QRS `≥130 ms`.
- **Additional Interventions:** Digoxin, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate, left ventricular assist device, and heart transplant for resistant symptoms and `LVEF ≤35%`.
- **Diuretics:** Loop diuretics or thiazides (e.g., furosemide `40 mg/24h` PO or bumetanide `1–2 mg/24h` PO) to maintain euvolaemia with the lowest dose.
- **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelet Therapy:** Not recommended unless the patient has atrial fibrillation.
- **Contraindicated Medications:** Calcium channel blockers, glitazones, NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors, as they can worsen symptoms and increase hospitalization risk.

### Heart Failure with Preserved or Midrange Ejection Fraction (`LVEF ≥40%`)

- **Diuretics:** For patients with congestion.
- **Comorbidity Management:** Screening and adequate management are crucial.
- **Medication:** ACEIs, ARBs, beta-blockers, and MRAs might help manage comorbidities but have not proven to reduce HF mortality.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Patients should be educated on lifestyle changes:

- Engage in regular aerobic exercise.
- Adopt a low-sodium (`<6g/day`) balanced diet to maintain or reduce weight if overweight/obese.
- Quit smoking and avoid recreational substances.
- Limit alcohol intake.
- Avoid excessive fluid intake.

Annual influenza vaccinations and a one-time pneumococcal vaccination are recommended for all HF patients.
