# Heart Failure: Diagnosis and Management

Heart failure is a condition defined as an inadequate cardiac output for the system’s metabolic demand and/or elevated intracardiac pressures. It can be caused by both structural and functional abnormalities. This condition affects approximately **1-3%** of the general adult population in developed countries and more than **10%** of people aged `>70 years`. It can present as an acute or chronic condition.

Based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart failure can be classified as:
- **Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**: LVEF is `<40%`.
- **Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**: LVEF is `≥50%`.

## Diagnosis

Symptoms and signs of heart failure are often non-specific, which can make differential diagnosis challenging. Objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction at rest is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

### Framingham Criteria

The **Framingham criteria** is a diagnostic tool used to confirm heart failure diagnosis. At least **2 major criteria** or **1 major and 2 minor criteria** are required:

| Major Criteria                                 | Minor Criteria                   |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Acute pulmonary oedema                          | Ankle oedema                     |
| Cardiomegaly                                   | Dyspnoea on exertion             |
| Hepatojugular reflux                           | Hepatomegaly                     |
| Neck vein distention                           | Nocturnal cough                  |
| Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea or orthopnoea  | Pleural effusion                 |
| Pulmonary rales                                | Tachycardia (`HR >120`)         |
| Third heart sound (S3 gallop rhythm)          |                                  |
| Weight loss `>4.5 kg` in `5 days` in response to treatment |                  |

### NYHA Functional Classification

1. **Class I**: Confirmed heart failure with no symptoms during everyday activities.
2. **Class II**: Small decrease in exercise tolerance; mild symptoms during everyday activities.
3. **Class III**: Significant decrease in exercise tolerance; severe symptoms during everyday activities, comfortable at rest.
4. **Class IV**: Severe limitations; symptoms at rest.

## Investigations

* Clinical history and physical examination, **ECG** – if any abnormality, order natriuretic peptides serum levels (if not available, order **echocardiography**).
* Refer individuals with suspected heart failure and an `NT‑proBNP` level between `400` and `2,000 ng/litre` (47 to 236 pmol/litre) to have specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within `6 weeks`. If normal levels, heart failure is highly unlikely.
* **Echocardiography** – used to look for the underlying cause of heart failure and assess LVEF.
* Other tests that can be used to find a cause: **FBC**, **U&E**, stress ECHO, **CXR**, **CMR**, endomyocardial biopsy.

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

Acute heart failure is a new onset or worsening of chronic heart failure symptoms, requiring urgent diagnosis and treatment. Possible triggers include:

- Acute coronary syndrome
- Arrhythmias
- Decompensation of metabolic disorders or hypertension
- Drugs (medications and recreational drugs)
- Pulmonary embolism

Patients may present with **cardiogenic shock** or **respiratory failure** and should be treated with circulatory and ventilator support. Specific management depends on the aetiology.

## Management (Prescribing)

If possible, always identify and treat the **underlying cause** of heart failure and manage comorbidities appropriately.

### Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (LVEF `<40%`)

* **ACEI** – recommended for all symptomatic patients; reduce mortality and morbidity.
* **Beta-blockers** – recommended for all symptomatic, stable patients; start with a low dose and slowly up-titrate to the maximum tolerated dose; reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and death. **ARB** (angiotensin II receptor blockers) can be used if ACEI is not tolerated.
* **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists** (spironolactone, eplerenone) – recommended for all patients who remain symptomatic despite maximum tolerated ACEI and beta-blocker doses.
* **ARNI** (angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors) – might be considered instead of ACEI/ARB for patients remaining symptomatic on the ACE + beta-blocker + MR antagonist regimen.
* **Calcium Channel Blockers (Ivabradine)** – to be considered for patients with resistant symptoms and sinus rhythm `≥70 bpm`.
* **CRT** (cardiac resynchronization therapy) – to be considered for patients with sinus rhythm and **QRS** `≥130 msec`.
* **Digoxin**, **hydralazine**, and **isosorbide dinitrate**, left ventricular assistant device, and heart transplant should be considered for patients with resistant symptoms and **LVEF ≤35%**.
* **Loop diuretics** or **thiazides** – e.g., furosemide `40 mg/24h PO` or bumetanide `1–2 mg/24h PO`; to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest achievable dose.
* **Oral anticoagulants** and **antiplatelet therapy** – not recommended unless for patients with atrial fibrillation.
* **Ca2+-blockers**, glitazones, NSAIDS, and COX-2-inhibitors – contraindicated, can worsen symptoms and increase the risk of hospitalization.

### Heart Failure with Preserved or Midrange Ejection Fraction (LVEF `≥40%`)

* **Diuretics** – recommended for patients with congestion.
* **Screening and adequate management of comorbidities**.
* **ACEIs, ARBs, beta-blockers,** and **MRAs** – were not proven to reduce mortality due to heart failure but may be effective in managing comorbidities.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Educate patients on recommended **lifestyle changes**:

* Undertake regular aerobic exercises.
* Follow a low-sodium (`<6g/day`), balanced, and healthy diet to maintain (or reduce if overweight/obese) weight.
* Stop smoking and using recreational substances.
* Avoid/limit alcohol intake.
* Avoid excessive fluid intake.

**Annual influenza vaccinations** and one-off **pneumococcal vaccination** are recommended for all patients with heart failure.

    question: "A 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents with progressively worsening dyspnea and bilateral ankle edema. Physical examination reveals elevated jugular venous pressure and a third heart sound. What Framingham criteria does he most likely fulfill to support a diagnosis of heart failure?",
    options: [
      "Acute pulmonary edema and hepatomegaly",
