# CHA2DS2-VASc Score and Management of Atrial Fibrillation

The **CHA2DS2-VASc score** is a straightforward tool used to evaluate the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). AF significantly increases the risk of ischemic stroke, but this risk is also influenced by other factors included in the CHA2DS2-VASc calculation. This score helps determine whether patients with AF would benefit from oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy.

## Diagnosis

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is calculated by assigning points to various risk factors as shown in Table 1. A higher score indicates a greater risk of thromboembolic events, primarily ischemic stroke. The implications of different scores are:

- A score of `2` or higher indicates a *high risk* of stroke without anticoagulation.
- A score of `1` in males indicates a *moderate risk*.
- A score of `1` in females indicates a *low risk* (i.e., no additional risk factors other than their sex).
- A score of `0` in males indicates a *low risk*.

### Table 1: CHA2DS2-VASc Risk Factors

| CHA2DS2-VASc Risk Factor                                          | Score |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **C**ongestive heart failure or Left ventricular dysfunction      | 1     |
| **H**ypertension                                                  | 1     |
| **A**ge `≥75 years`                                               | 2     |
| **D**iabetes mellitus                                             | 1     |
| **S**troke, TIA, or thromboembolism                               | 2     |
| **V**ascular disease (peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction, or aortic plaque) | 1     |
| **A**ge `65–74 years`                                             | 1     |
| **S**ex **c**ategory (female)                                     | 1     |
| **Maximum score**                                                 | **9** |

## Investigations

No specific investigations are needed to calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score. However, in cases of new AF, an assessment for hemodynamic instability and a routine work-up to identify potential causes is necessary. The choice of investigations can vary based on the clinical context but may include:

- **Blood Tests**: Full blood count (FBC), urea and electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, thyroid function tests, and glucose.
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To check for signs of ischemic heart disease.
- **Transthoracic Echocardiography**: To identify structural or functional heart disease.
- **Chest X-ray**: To detect chest infections or lung cancer.

## Management (Prescribing)

The use of OACs can significantly lower the risk of thromboembolic events in AF patients, with a relative risk reduction of about two-thirds. According to most guidelines, including NICE, anticoagulation should be considered when the stroke risk exceeds `1%` per year (Table 2). Patients with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score `≥2` should be offered OAC therapy, and males with a score of `1` may also benefit.

### Preferred Antithrombotic Therapies

- **Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA)**: e.g., warfarin.
- **Non-VKA Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs or DOACs)**: e.g., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban.
- *Note*: Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and/or clopidogrel is not recommended for stroke risk reduction in AF patients.

**Warning:** All antithrombotic agents increase bleeding risk, particularly the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Perform a bleeding risk assessment, such as calculating the HAS-BLED score, when considering OAC therapy.

### Table 2: Stroke Risk Stratification

| CHA2DS2-VASc Score | Ischemic Stroke Rate (Mean, % per year) | Risk           | Management Recommendation      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **0**              | 0.2%                                   | Low (male)     | No antithrombotic therapy      |
| **1**              | 0.6%                                   | Low (female), Moderate (male) | Consider OAC                  |
| **≥2**             | ≥2.2%                                  | High           | OAC                            |

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

The CHA2DS2-VASc score should be recalculated at least annually for patients with AF. Those on warfarin or NOACs require systematic blood monitoring, usually including INR, renal function, liver function, and FBC.

Surgical options, such as left atrial surgical ablation, may be considered in some AF patients, typically performed alongside other cardiothoracic surgeries.
