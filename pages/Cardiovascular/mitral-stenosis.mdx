# Understanding Mitral Stenosis

Mitral stenosis is a condition characterized by the narrowing between the mitral valve leaflets due to their thickening or fusion. The predominant cause is rheumatic fever, accounting for 95% of cases. Other less common causes include age-related calcification, congenital defects, carcinoid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), amyloidosis, and certain drug use.

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms

Patients with mild mitral stenosis may not exhibit symptoms initially. However, as the condition progresses and the blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle becomes severely restricted, symptoms of left heart failure (LHF) emerge due to increased left atrial pressure and pulmonary congestion:

- **Dyspnoea:** Gradual onset of shortness of breath during exertion.
- **Orthopnoea:** Shortness of breath when lying flat, often requiring patients to sleep propped up with pillows.
- **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnoea:** Sudden night-time breathlessness or coughing that disrupts sleep.
- **Palpitations:** Increased heart rate to compensate for weakened contractility, potentially leading to irregular rhythms.
- **Haemoptysis:** Coughing up frothy pink sputum.

As LHF worsens, right heart failure (RHF) can occur due to pulmonary hypertension, presenting symptoms such as:

- **Peripheral Oedema:** Swelling of the extremities.

### Physical Examination

Key indicators during examination include:

- **Malar Flush:** Reddish discoloration on the cheeks.
- **Heart Murmur:** A mid-diastolic, rumbling murmur with a low pitch followed by an opening snap.
  - Best heard at the apex (left 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line) in the left lateral position.
  - Accentuated by handgrip exercise.
  - Accompanied by a loud S1.
- **Tapping Apex Beat**
- Signs of LHF:
  - Irregularly irregular pulse (atrial fibrillation).
  - Coarse end-inspiratory crackles (pulmonary oedema).
  - Loud P2 (pulmonary hypertension).
- Signs of RHF:
  - Pitting oedema.
  - Ascites.
  - Raised Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP).

## Investigations

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**
  - Irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves (atrial fibrillation).
  - `P mitrale`: Bifid or M-shaped P waves in lead II, `V1-V6` indicating left atrial enlargement.
  - Right axis deviation, dominant `R` wave in `V1`, and dominant `S` wave in `V6` indicating right ventricular hypertrophy.
  
- **Chest X-ray:**
  - Pulmonary oedema signs.
  - Double shadow on the right cardiac border hinting at left atrial enlargement.
  - Mitral valve calcification.
  
- **Transthoracic Echocardiography:**
  - First-line diagnostic tool for mitral stenosis.
  - Measures mitral orifice area and pulmonary artery pressure.
  - Assesses anatomy for balloon valvotomy.

- **Additional Tests:**
  - Transoesophageal echocardiography to clarify diagnosis or check for thrombus pre-valvotomy.
  - Cardiac catheterisation if echocardiography is inconclusive or surgery is planned.
  - Dynamic exercise testing for symptom evaluation and surgical intervention necessity.

## Management

### Medications

- **Diuretics:** First-line treatment to reduce left atrial pressure and alleviate mild symptoms. Options include furosemide or bumetanide.
  
<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Note:** Post-surgical patients may require anticoagulation with warfarin, monitored six-weekly to maintain `INR 2-3` (`2.5-3.5` for mechanical valves).
</Callout>

### Non-Medication Approaches

Management strategies depend on disease severity:

- **Progressive Asymptomatic Disease:** No intervention required if the mitral valve gradient is `<5 mmHg` and valve area is `>1.5 cm²`.
  
- **Asymptomatic Severe Disease:** No immediate therapy if the gradient is `>5 mmHg` and valve area is `<1.5 cm²`. Consider percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy if:
  - Valve area `<1.0 cm²` with favorable anatomy.
  - Valve area `<1.0 cm²` with atrial fibrillation.
  - Pulmonary hypertension is present.

- **Severe Symptomatic Disease:** Surgical intervention is necessary alongside diuretics. Valve repair options depend on a scoring system for:
  - Valve mobility.
  - Calcification.
  - Leaflet thickening.
  - Subvalvular apparatus.

  **Repair Options:**
  - **Percutaneous Balloon Mitral Valvotomy:** Recommended for scores `<9`, especially in patients unfit for open surgery.
  - **Open Valve Replacement:** Preferred for scores `>9`.
    - Mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulation.
    - Prosthetic valves need short-term anticoagulation but may require future replacements.
  - **Valve Repair (Open Valve Commissurotomy):** Less common but possible.

Patients are monitored annually to ensure symptom resolution.

  {
    question: "A 48-year-old woman with a history of rheumatic fever presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and occasional palpitations. On physical examination, you note a malar flush and a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur best heard at the apex in the left lateral position. An echocardiogram shows a mitral valve area of 1.2 cm². Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Start diuretics and observe",

    correctFeedback: "Correct! Percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy is indicated for severe mitral stenosis with a valve area <1.5 cm² and favorable valve anatomy. This procedure is less invasive and can relieve symptoms effectively.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the severity of the mitral stenosis and the patient's symptoms. What management option can relieve the obstruction in a minimally invasive way?"
