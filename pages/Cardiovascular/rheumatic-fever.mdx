# Rheumatic Fever: A Comprehensive Overview

Rheumatic fever has significantly declined in developed countries throughout the 20th century due to advances such as penicillin, decreased pathogen virulence, and improved living conditions. However, it remains a prevalent cause of chronic heart disease and mortality in developing nations.

## Pathogenesis

The exact pathogenesis of rheumatic fever is not fully understood. It is believed to result from an immune hypersensitivity reaction following an infection with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus. This condition can affect the joints, skin, heart, and nervous system. Genetic factors play a role, as indicated by a 44% monozygotic concordance in twin studies. In cases of acute rheumatic fever, the mitral valve is involved in `90-95%` of patients, with `20-25%` also experiencing aortic valve involvement.

## Diagnosis

Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease account for approximately `233,000` deaths annually. Both primary and recurrent fever episodes occur at similar rates. The likelihood of carditis and valve damage increases with repeated attacks. In high-income countries, the incidence is less than `1 per 100,000` people, with school-aged children being most affected.

### Risk Factors and History

- **Risk Factors:**
  - Young age
  - Overcrowded living conditions
  - Poor hygiene
  - Limited access to healthcare

- **Regional Variations:**
  - In warmer climates, skin infections are more likely to cause streptococcal infections.
  - Pharyngitis is more common in developed regions.

Symptoms typically appear about three weeks after a sore throat, with a shorter duration in recurrent cases due to a faster immune response.

### Jones Criteria for Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on the Jones Criteria, requiring evidence of recent streptococcal infection (e.g., history of scarlet fever, positive throat swab, or rising antistreptolysin) plus two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria.

#### Major Criteria:

- **Arthritis:** Migratory arthritis affecting large joints, usually one or two at a time.
- **Carditis (`40%` of patients):** Pan-carditis affecting pericardium, endocardium, and myocardium. Examination may reveal tachycardia, pericardial rub, aortic regurgitation, and mitral valve involvement.
- **Chorea (Sydenham’s chorea) (`10-30%` of patients):** Rapid, random, purposeless movements, typically in children aged 7-12.
- **Subcutaneous Nodules (`10%` of patients):** Appear over extensor surfaces like elbows, knees, and ankles.
- **Erythema Marginatum (`5-15%` of patients):** Pale-red macules or papules on the trunk and proximal limbs, sparing the face.

#### Minor Criteria:

- **Fever (`90%` of patients):** Typically over `39°C`, remains high for about a week.
- **Elevated ESR and serum CRP**
- **Arthralgia** (in absence of arthritis)
- **Prolonged PR interval on ECG** (in absence of carditis)

## Investigations

- **Throat Swabs:** Often performed but may not detect streptococci by the time symptoms appear.
- **Antistreptococcal Antibodies:** Particularly useful for patients with only chorea.
  - Monitor antibody titres two weeks apart.
  - Common antibodies include ASO and anti-DNase B. ASO peaks 2-3 weeks post-onset, with a sensitivity of `80-85%`. Anti-DNase B sensitivity is `90%`.
- **ECG:** May show prolonged PR interval with tachycardia or bradycardia. Generalized ST elevation suggests pericarditis.
- **Chest X-Ray:** Can indicate heart failure.
- **Doppler ECHO:** More sensitive than clinical assessments for detecting carditis.

## Management

### Pharmacological Treatment

- **Antibiotics:** Penicillin for any remaining organisms; alternatives include erythromycin or cephalosporin for allergies.
- **Recurrent Pharyngitis:** A second 10-day course of penicillin may be necessary. Oral clindamycin is recommended for difficult cases.
- **Arthritis Relief:** Naproxen is preferred. High-dose aspirin is risky due to Reye’s syndrome.
- **Heart Failure:** Use diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digoxin.
- **Chorea:** Diazepam for suppression; haloperidol is another option but may cause extrapyramidal effects.

### Non-Pharmacological Management

- **Cardiac Surgery:** Indicated if medical management of heart failure fails, often requiring mitral valve replacement.
- **Secondary Prevention:** Long-term antibiotic regimen to prevent further streptococcal infections. Duration is debated.

  {
    question: "A 12-year-old boy presents with fever, joint pain affecting his knees and ankles, and a rash on his trunk. Three weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved without treatment. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis",
      "Rheumatic fever",
      "Systemic lupus erythematosus",
      "Kawasaki disease",
      "Henoch-Schönlein purpura"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This clinical presentation is consistent with rheumatic fever, supported by the recent sore throat and migratory arthritis affecting large joints, along with a characteristic rash.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the recent history of sore throat and migratory joint pain. Which condition is known to follow streptococcal infection and presents with these symptoms?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 10-year-old girl is diagnosed with rheumatic fever. Which of the following major criteria from the Jones criteria would NOT be expected in her clinical presentation?",
    options: [
      "Migratory arthritis",
      "Sydenham's chorea",
      "Erythema marginatum",
      "Subcutaneous nodules",
      "Aplastic anemia"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Aplastic anemia is not a major criterion in the Jones criteria for rheumatic fever. The major criteria include arthritis, carditis, chorea, subcutaneous nodules, and erythema marginatum.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the Jones criteria for diagnosing rheumatic fever. Which of the listed options does not fit the major manifestations of this condition?"

      "C-reactive protein (CRP)",
      "Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer",
      "Chest X-ray"

    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An elevated antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer is indicative of a recent streptococcal infection and is useful in supporting the diagnosis of rheumatic fever.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which test specifically indicates a previous streptococcal infection rather than general inflammation or current infection."
