# Rheumatic Fever: Overview, Diagnosis, and Management

Rheumatic fever has significantly reduced in incidence throughout the 20th century in developed countries due to the invention of **penicillin**, reduction of pathogen virulence, and improvements in social conditions. However, in developing countries, it remains a major cause of chronic structural heart disease and death. 

The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but it is caused by an **immune hypersensitivity** cross-reaction to an infection with *group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus*. The condition may affect various systems, including the joints, skin, heart, and nervous system, with genetic susceptibility indicated by a 44% monozygotic concordance observed in twin studies.

## **Epidemiology**

- At least **233,000 deaths** are attributable to rheumatic fever or rheumatic disease each year.
- Primary and recurrent episodes of fever are equally common.
- The risk of **carditis** and valve damage increases with subsequent attacks.
- The incidence in high-income countries is less than `1 per 100,000` of the population, with the highest incidence observed among school-aged children.

### **History and Risk Factors**

*Risk factors include:*

- **Young age**
- **Overcrowding**
- **Poor hygiene**
- **Lack of access to medical services**
- In hotter countries, skin infections are more likely to be the source of streptococci compared to pharyngitis in more developed regions.

*Symptoms appear an average of `three weeks` following a sore throat, which is shorter in recurrent cases due to a faster immune response.*

## **Diagnosis**

Diagnosis is based on the **Jones Criteria**, which classify the findings into major and minor criteria:

### **Major Criteria**

1. **Arthritis**: Fitting or migratory arthritis affecting large joints; typically affects one or two joints at a time.
   - *NSAIDs*, except aspirin, may be considered due to the possibility of Reye's syndrome.
   
2. **Carditis** (40% of patients): Pan-carditis affecting the pericardium, endocardium, and myocardium.
   - Examination may show tachycardia, pericardial rub, aortic regurgitation, and mitral valve involvement.

3. **Chorea** (Sydenhamâ€™s chorea) (10-30% of patients): Rapid, random, purposeless movements predominantly in children aged 7-12 years.

4. **Subcutaneous nodules** (10% of patients): Appear over the extensor surfaces of elbows, knees, ankles, knuckles, and scalp.

5. **Erythema Marginatum** (5-15% of patients): Rash characterized by pale-red macules or papules `1-3 cm` in diameter on the trunk and proximal limbs, sparing the face.

### **Minor Criteria**

- **Fever** (90% of patients): Usually over `39 degrees`, remaining high for a week.
- Raised **ESR** and serum **CRP**.
- **Arthralgia** (not if arthritic).
- Prolonged **PR interval** on ECG (not if carditic).

### **Investigations**

- **Throat swabs**: Commonly performed but may not grow streptococci by the time rheumatic fever symptoms appear.
- **Antistreptococcal antibodies**: Important for patients with only chorea.
  - Check antibody titres two weeks apart for a rise.
  - The most common antibodies include ASO and anti-DNase B. 
- **ECG**: May show a prolonged PR interval and tachycardia; generalized ST elevation suggests pericarditis.
- **Chest X-Ray**: Possible signs of heart failure.
- **Doppler ECHO**: More sensitive than clinical assessment for detection of carditis in acute rheumatic fever.

## **Management**

### **Prescribing**

- **Penicillin**: Administer if any organism is still present.
  - Alternatives for those allergic include:
    - **Erythromycin**
    - **Cephalosporins**

- For recurrent pharyngitis, a second `10-day` course of penicillin may be given; however, eradication of carriage is often difficult.
  - **Oral clindamycin** is recommended for recurrent cases.

- **Naproxen**: Used to relieve arthritis symptoms. 

- **High-dose aspirin** is risky due to the risk of Reyeâ€™s syndrome.

- **Heart failure treatment**: 
  - Diuretics
  - ACE inhibitors
  - Digoxin

- **Chorea management**: 
  - Diazepam for suppression.
  - Haloperidol may be used but poses a risk of extrapyramidal effects.

### **Non-Prescribing**

- If medical management of heart failure is unsuccessful, **cardiac surgery**, often a mitral valve replacement, may be indicated, even in cases of progressing acute cardiac failure.

- **Secondary prevention**: 
  - Every patient should initiate a long-term program of regular antibiotics to prevent further streptococcal infections. 
  - Duration of prophylaxis is subject to some controversy.

### **Follow-Up and Monitoring**

To ensure effective management and prevention of recurrence, regular follow-up visits are necessary, including monitoring of heart function and review of symptoms.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 10-year-old boy presents to the clinic with fever, joint pain, and a recent history of sore throat. Upon examination, you note multiple swollen joints and a heart murmur. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial investigation to support the diagnosis of rheumatic fever?",
    options: [
      "Throat swab for group A strep culture",
      "Echocardiogram to assess cardiac function",
      "Antistreptococcal antibody testing",
      "Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring",
      "Chest X-ray for cardiac silhouette"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! While all investigations may provide valuable information, the antistreptococcal antibody testing helps in confirming a preceding group A strep infection, which is crucial in diagnosing rheumatic fever. An echocardiogram is also important to assess valve involvement but is not the primary investigation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the key investigations that are characteristic for rheumatic fever. Focus on the initial step that links the current presentation (joint pain, fever) to a recent streptococcal infection. Consider what would indicate a positive streptococcal history."
  },
  {
    question: "Which criteria are used in the diagnosis of rheumatic fever, specifying major and minor classifications?",
    options: [
      "Move to the guidelines set by the World Health Organization only",
      "Jones Criteria based on clinical and laboratory findings",
      "American College of Cardiology criteria for infectious diseases",
      "Rheumatic Heart Disease criteria",
      "International Classification of Diseases criteria"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The diagnosis of rheumatic fever relies on the Jones Criteria, which includes both major and minor criteria based on clinical signs and laboratory tests. These criteria are established to guide the diagnosis effectively.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the various criteria available for diagnosing rheumatic fever. Focus specifically on nomenclature associated with rheumatic disease diagnosis rather than general guidelines."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with rheumatic fever develops severe carditis. Which management strategy is recommended to alleviate heart failure symptoms?",

      "Close observation with no intervention"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! To manage heart failure symptoms in rheumatic fever with carditis, diuretics and ACE inhibitors are essential to reduce fluid overload and improve cardiac function. These medications are part of standard treatment protocols.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the treatment options available for managing heart failure in rheumatic fever. Pay attention to the most effective supportive measures, considering both symptom relief and potential risks."
  },
  {
