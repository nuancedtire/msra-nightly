# Understanding Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia. It is characterized by an irregular and erratic pulse without a discernible pattern, leading to a disconnection between the heart's apex beat and the radial pulsation. This condition results in:

- **Blood Stagnation:** Blood pooling in the atria can form clots, increasing the risk of embolism and potential stroke.
- **Reduced Cardiac Output:** Particularly during physical exertion, this may result in heart failure.

## Categorizing AF

- **Acute AF:** Occurs within the last 48 hours.
- **Paroxysmal AF:** Ends spontaneously within seven days, typically within two days, but may progress to persistent AF.
- **Recurrent AF:** Includes two or more episodes, classified as paroxysmal or persistent if cardioversion is required.
- **Persistent AF:** Lasts more than seven days or requires cardioversion, potentially developing into permanent AF.
- **Permanent AF:** Persists for over a year and is not terminated by cardioversion or has relapsed after it.

## Diagnosis

AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, with its prevalence increasing. It is more common in males and affects around 3% of adults, with higher rates in older individuals and those with conditions like hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease.

### History

A comprehensive history is crucial, covering cardiovascular risk factors, endocrine, medical, family, drug, and social histories.

- **Common Causes:** Coronary heart disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and hyperthyroidism.
- **Associated Factors:** 
  - *Cardiac Conditions:* Rheumatic heart disease, sick sinus syndrome, pre-excitation syndromes, heart failure, etc.
  - *Non-Cardiac Causes:* Drugs like thyroxine, acute infection, electrolyte imbalances, lung cancer, etc.
  - *Lifestyle Factors:* Excessive caffeine or alcohol intake, and obesity.

Lone AF, where no obvious cause is found and all tests are normal, occurs in up to 11% of AF cases, more often in those with paroxysmal AF (30-40%).

### Signs and Symptoms

A thorough examination, including radial pulse assessment, is necessary. Patients may experience:

- Dyspnoea
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Stroke or transient ischemic attack
- Syncope
- Dizziness
- Palpitations

## Investigations

- **ECG:** Essential for all suspected AF cases due to detected irregular pulse. Variability in `R-R` intervals is diagnostic, except in paroxysmal AF between episodes. Use a 24-hour ECG monitor for episodes less than 24 hours apart, or an event recorder ECG for episodes more than 24 hours apart.

### Blood Tests

- **TFTs:** Hyperthyroidism may cause AF.
- **FBC:** Anemia may trigger heart failure.
- **Renal Function and Electrolytes:** Abnormal potassium levels can cause arrhythmias.
- **LFTs and Coagulation Screen:** Necessary if anticoagulation with warfarin is considered.

### Chest X-Ray

May reveal cardiac structural causes of AF, such as mitral valve disease or heart failure.

### Echocardiography

- **TTE:** For baseline echocardiogram, considering rhythm-control strategies, or suspected underlying heart disease.
- **TOE:** If TTE shows abnormalities or for TOE-guided cardioversion considerations.

### CT Head or MRI

Conduct if stroke or TIA is suspected.

### Scoring Systems

- **CHA2DS2-VASc:** Assesses stroke risk in those with AF.
- **HAS-BLED:** Evaluates bleeding risk in patients starting anticoagulation.

## Management (Prescribing)

Focus on arrhythmia control (rhythm or rate) and thromboprophylaxis for stroke prevention. Address any underlying causes such as infection or hyperthyroidism.

### Anticoagulation

- **Options:** Apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or vitamin K antagonists like warfarin.
- **Indication:** Offer to those with `CHA2DS2-VASc` score `>=2`, considering bleeding risks.
- **Note:** Do not use aspirin monotherapy for stroke prevention in AF.

### Rate Control

First-line strategy, unless:

- AF has a reversible cause.
- Heart failure is primarily due to AF.
- It is new-onset AF.
- Rhythm control is more suitable.

- **Initial Monotherapy:** Standard beta-blocker or rate-limiting calcium-channel blocker.
- **Digoxin:** Consider for sedentary individuals with non-paroxysmal AF.
- **Combination Therapy:** For poor ventricular rate control, use two of beta-blocker, diltiazem, or digoxin.
- **Avoid:** Long-term use of amiodarone for rate control.

### Rhythm Control

Consider for those with persistent symptoms after heart rate control or unsuccessful rate-control strategy.

### Cardioversion

For AF persisting over 48 hours, offer electrical cardioversion.

- **Amiodarone Therapy:** Start four weeks prior and continue up to 12 months post-cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm.
- **Cardioversion Indications:** For AF >48 hours, consider TOE-guided or conventional strategies based on preference, facilities, and bleeding risks.

### Long-term Rhythm Control

Evaluate need based on personal preferences, comorbidities, treatment risks, and recurrence likelihood.

- **First-Line Treatment:** Standard beta-blocker unless contraindicated.
- **Alternative Drugs:** Consider if beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Referrals

- **Urgent Admission:** For ‘Fast AF’, loss of consciousness, severe symptoms, or complications like stroke or heart failure.
- **Routine Referral:** If under 50, suspected paroxysmal AF, uncertainty in control strategy, contraindicated or failed drug treatments, valve disease, or suspected Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

### Lifestyle Management

- **Smoking Cessation:** Reduces coronary heart disease and AF risk.
- **Alcohol Moderation:** Prevents paroxysmal AF.
- **Dietary Adjustments:** Limit caffeine intake.

### Left Atrial Ablation

- **Consider for:** Paroxysmal or persistent AF when drugs fail.
- **Surgical Ablation:** During other cardiothoracic surgeries for symptomatic AF.

### Pace and Ablate

- **Pacing and AV Node Ablation:** For permanent AF causing symptoms or left ventricular dysfunction.
- **Catheter Ablation:** Consider before pacing and AV node ablation for paroxysmal AF or heart failure caused by non-permanent AF.

## Management of Acute AF

### Rate and Rhythm Control

- **Emergency Cardioversion:** Required for life-threatening instability due to new-onset AF.
- **Rate/Rhythm Control:** For acute AF with haemodynamic instability, based on arrhythmia duration.

- **Pharmacological Options:** Flecainide or amiodarone with no structural or coronary heart disease; amiodarone for structural disease.

- **Delayed Cardioversion:** For AF >48 hours, maintain therapeutic anticoagulation for three weeks prior.

### Anticoagulation

- **New-Onset AF:** Administer heparin initially, followed by oral anticoagulation for confirmed recent AF.
