# Atrial Fibrillation (AF)

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, characterised by **irregularly irregular pulse** and the loss of association between the cardiac apex beat and radial pulsation. This condition is associated with:

- Stagnation of blood in the atria, leading to thrombus formation and a risk of clot embolism, increasing the risk of stroke.
- Reduction in cardiac output (especially during exercise), which may lead to heart failure.

## Categorising AF

1. **Acute**: Onset within the previous 48 hours.
2. **Paroxysmal**: Spontaneous termination within seven days, often within 2 days. This may, however, deteriorate to sustained AF.
3. **Recurrent**: Two or more episodes, defined as:
   - **Paroxysmal**: fits the criteria above
   - **Persistent**: requires any form of cardioversion.
4. **Persistent**: Not self-terminating, lasting longer than seven days or prior cardioversion.
5. **Permanent**: Long-standing AF (over a year) that is not successfully terminated by cardioversion and when cardioversion is not pursued.

## Diagnosis

AF is increasingly prevalent, particularly among older adults and those with co-morbid conditions. Important statistics include:

- Approximately 3% of adults have AF, with a greater prevalence in older patients and those with **hypertension**, **heart failure**, **coronary artery disease**, **valvular heart disease**, **obesity**, **diabetes mellitus**, or **chronic kidney disease**.

### History

A thorough history is crucial and should include:

- **Cardiovascular risk factors**
- **Endocrine history**
- **Medical history**
- **Family history**
- **Drug history**
- **Social history**

**Common causes of AF** include:

- **Coronary heart disease**
- **Hypertension**
- **Valvular heart disease**
- **Hyperthyroidism**

#### Other Contributing Factors:

- Cardiac conditions such as:
  - Rheumatic heart disease
  - Sick sinus syndrome
  - Pre-excitation syndromes (e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)
- Less common cardiac causes like:
  - Cardiomyopathy
  - Atrial septal defect
  - Atrial myxoma
- Non-cardiac causes such as:
  - Drugs (e.g., thyroxine, bronchodilators)
  - Infections
  - Electrolyte imbalances
- Dietary and lifestyle factors including:
  - Excessive caffeine or alcohol intake
  - Obesity

**Lone AF** occurs in up to 11% of patients and is more common in individuals with paroxysmal AF (30-40% prevalence).

### Signs and Symptoms

A comprehensive examination, including assessment of the radial pulse, is essential. **Common presentations** may include:

- Dyspnoea
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Stroke or transient ischaemic attack
- Syncope
- Dizziness
- Palpitations

<details>
<summary>Common Signs and Symptoms</summary>

- **Chest Pain**
  - Crushing or pressure-like
  - Radiates to left arm, jaw, or back
  - Accompanied by sweating

- **Respiratory**
  - Shortness of breath
  - Rapid breathing
  - Orthopnea

- **Other Symptoms**
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Fatigue
  - Light-headedness
  - Anxiety

</details>

## Investigations

**ECG**: Essential in all suspected AF cases, diagnosing AF by variability in the R-R intervals.

- 24-hour ambulatory ECG for suspected paroxysmal AF that has not been detected yet.
- Event recorder ECG for symptomatic episodes occurring more than 24 hours apart.

### Blood Tests

- Thyroid function tests (TFTs) to check for hyperthyroidism
- Full blood count (FBC) for anemia
- Renal function and electrolytes
- Liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation screen if considering anticoagulation therapy.

### Imaging

- **Chest X-ray**: May reveal structural cardiac causes.
- **TTE (Transthoracic Echocardiography)**: Recommended if:
  - A baseline echocardiogram is crucial for long-term management.
  - A rhythm-control strategy including cardioversion is considered.
  - High suspicion of underlying heart disease influences management.

**TOE (Transoesophageal Echocardiography)** should be used when:

- TTE reveals abnormalities necessitating further assessment.
- TOE-guided cardioversion is being contemplated.

### Scoring Systems

- **CHA2DS2-VASc**: Stroke risk score for AF patients with or without symptoms.
- **HAS-BLED**: Assesses bleeding risk for patients starting anticoagulation.

## Management (Prescribing)

### Anticoagulation

- Options include **apixaban**, **dabigatran**, **rivaroxaban**, or a **vitamin K antagonist** (e.g., warfarin).
- Anticoagulation should be offered for individuals with a **CHA2DS2-VASc score** of 2 or above, considering bleeding risk.

#### Rate Control

**First-line strategy** for stable patients is rate control, except for:

- Individuals with reversible causes for AF
- Those with heart failure attributed to AF
- Patients with new-onset AF

--- 

### Rhythm Control

Consider pharmacological and/or electrical rhythm control for patients with persistent symptoms despite rate control.

### Cardioversion

- **Electrical cardioversion** should be offered for AF persisting longer than 48 hours.
- **Amiodarone** may be administered before and after cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Referrals

Prompt referral may be necessary if AF symptoms remain uncontrolled, with **urgent** admissions for:

- Fast AF (greater than 150 bpm)
- Loss of consciousness or severe symptoms
- Complications of AF like stroke or acute heart failure.

### Lifestyle Modifications

Advise lifestyle changes targeting AF triggers:

- **Smoking cessation**: Reduces coronary heart disease risk.
- **Alcohol moderation**: Prevents paroxysmal AF induced by intoxication or withdrawal.
- **Diet**: Limiting caffeine intake for susceptible individuals.

### Left Atrial Ablation

Consider for patients whose symptoms remain uncontrolled on drug therapy, suitable for paroxysmal or persistent AF.

### PACE and ABLATE

- Pacing and atrioventricular node ablation is an option for those with symptoms from permanent AF.
- **Catheter ablation** may also be evaluated.

## Management of Acute AF

### Rate and Rhythm Control

**Emergency electrical cardioversion** is crucial for life-threatening haemodynamic instability due to new-onset AF. 

- Patients presenting acutely with AF may begin rate or rhythm control depending on the duration of the arrhythmia.

### Anticoagulation

Initiate **heparin** for new-onset AF lacking anticoagulation therapy until a thorough assessment occurs.

  {
    question: "A 75-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease presents with palpitations and dyspnea. An ECG reveals atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. His CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is 3. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?",
