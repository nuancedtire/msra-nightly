# Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvular disease affecting approximately **2.4%** of the US population. It is characterized by the **bulging of the mitral valve leaflet(s)** into the left atrium during systole. While many patients remain asymptomatic, MVP can lead to significant complications, including:

- **Mitral regurgitation**
- **Infective endocarditis**
- **Sudden cardiac death**

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors

The following are notable risk factors associated with MVP:

- **Connective tissue disorders**:
  - Marfan syndrome
  - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
  - Osteogenesis imperfecta
  - Pseudoxanthoma elasticum
- **Family history of MVP**
- **Thin body habitus**

### Symptoms

Patients with MVP are often asymptomatic but may present with:

- Palpitations
- Syncope
- Atypical chest pain
- Anxiety

### Auscultation Findings

On auscultation, classic findings may include:

- **Mid-systolic click**
- **Late systolic murmur**:
  - Medium to high-pitched, varying in length (indicative of mitral regurgitation)

**Note**: The timing of the click and murmur can be affected by hemodynamic changes:
- **Earlier** in systole with decreased preload (e.g., standing, Valsalva maneuver) or increased afterload (e.g., amyl nitrate)
- **Later** in systole with increased preload (e.g., squatting) or decreased afterload (e.g., handgrip maneuvers)

## Investigations

- **Echocardiogram**: Diagnostic test; findings include:
  - Prolapse of leaflet > `2mm` above level of annulus in systole, specifically on long-axis parasternal or apical view on 2D imaging.
  
- **Holter or ambulatory event monitoring**: Indicated for patients presenting with palpitations or syncope to identify arrhythmias.

## Management (Prescribing)

### Asymptomatic Patients

- No specific treatment is required.

### Patients Requiring Medication

**Aspirin** (75-300 mg orally once daily) is prescribed for MVP patients with:

- **Atrial fibrillation**
- **Ischaemic stroke**
- **History of transient ischaemic attack**

**Warfarin** (2-10 mg orally once daily, titrate to target INR of `2-3`) is recommended for:

- Patients with a **previous systemic embolism**
- Patients with **atrial fibrillation** (including post-operative)

**Beta-blocker therapy** may be beneficial for alleviating:

- Palpitations
- Anxiety
- Atypical chest pain

**Note**: MVP patients experiencing severe mitral regurgitation who cannot undergo surgery may require **medical therapy** if in heart failure (e.g., digoxin, vasodilators, angiotensin blockers, diuretics).

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

For alleviating palpitations, patients are advised to avoid:

- Stress
- Stimulants (e.g., caffeine or nicotine)
- Alcohol

### Surgical Considerations

**Mitral valve repair** is indicated in patients with severe mitral regurgitation who present with:

- **Left ventricular dysfunction**
- **Pulmonary hypertension**
- **Atrial fibrillation**

**Percutaneous mitral valve repair** serves as an inferior alternative and is reserved for those unfit for surgery or with severe mitral regurgitation unresponsive to medical management.

  {
    question: "A 25-year-old female presents with palpitations and atypical chest pain. An echocardiogram reveals mitral valve prolapse with a prolapse of the anterior leaflet. What additional finding would you expect on auscultation?",
    options: [
      "A mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur",
      "An early diastolic snap",
      "A continuous murmur",
      "An opening snap followed by a diastolic rumble",
      "A high-pitched early systolic murmur"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The characteristic auscultatory findings in mitral valve prolapse include a mid-systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur caused by the regurgitation of blood due to the valve bulging into the left atrium.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the typical heart sounds associated with mitral valve prolapse. Which sound signifies the mitral valve anatomy's unique motion during systole?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is found to have mitral valve prolapse during a routine examination. Which complication should be monitored closely in this patient?",

      "Mitral regurgitation",
      "Severe pulmonary hypertension",
      "Aortic stenosis",
      "Pulmonary embolism",
      "Coronary artery disease"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Patients with mitral valve prolapse, particularly those with connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, are at risk for developing mitral regurgitation as a complication.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the common complications associated with mitral valve prolapse specifically within patients who have connective tissue disorders. What is the primary concern regarding valve function in such patients?"

    question: "A 60-year-old male patient with untreated hypertension presents with severe mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral valve prolapse. What is the most appropriate management option for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Beta-blockers",
      "Anticoagulation therapy",
      "Mitral valve repair",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In patients with severe mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction, surgical intervention such as mitral valve repair is often indicated to prevent further complications.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the treatment options available for severe mitral regurgitation. What does the presence of left ventricular dysfunction typically indicate regarding intervention?"

      "Increase alcohol consumption in moderation",
      "No modifications are necessary"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Patients with mitral valve prolapse should be advised to minimize stress and avoid stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine, as they can exacerbate palpitations.",
