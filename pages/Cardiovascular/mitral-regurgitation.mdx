# Mitral Regurgitation: An Overview

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a type of **valvular heart disease** characterized by the backflow of blood through an incompetent mitral valve from the left ventricle to the left atrium. This condition can be categorized into **acute** and **chronic** forms.

## Types of Mitral Regurgitation

### Acute Mitral Regurgitation
- Often arises from:
  - **Infective endocarditis**
  - **Papillary muscle dysfunction**
  - **Rheumatic fever**
  - **Acute left ventricular dilatation** secondary to ischaemia

### Chronic Mitral Regurgitation
- Common causes include:
  - **Mitral valve prolapse (MVP)**
  - **Thickening and elongation** of the mitral apparatus, frequently due to connective tissue disorders.

## Diagnosis

Patients with **mild MR** are often asymptomatic. Symptoms typically emerge as stress on the left ventricle leads to **left heart failure (LHF)** and resulting pulmonary congestion.

### Common Symptoms
- **Gradually increasing dyspnoea** (shortness of breath) on exertion
- **Orthopnoea** – shortness of breath when lying flat
- **Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea** – episodes of shortness of breath or coughing at night
- **Palpitations** – increased heart rate due to weakened contractility
- **Haemoptysis** – cough with frothy pink sputum
- **Fatigue**

As LHF worsens, increased left atrial pressure may lead to **right heart failure (RHF)**. Symptoms of RHF include:
- **Peripheral oedema**

### Physical Examination Signs
- **Murmur** – pansystolic, best heard at the apex (5th left intercostal space, mid clavicular line)
- **Displaced apex** – laterally on the thorax due to left ventricular dilatation
- **Signs of LHF**:
  - Irregularly irregular pulse (attributed to atrial fibrillation)
  - Coarse end-inspiratory crackles (due to pulmonary oedema)
  - Loud P2 (indicative of pulmonary hypertension)
- **Signs of RHF**:
  - Pitting oedema in lower limbs or sacrum
  - Ascites
  - Raised JVP 

## Investigations

1. **ECG**:
   - May show irregularly irregular rhythm and absence of P waves (atrial fibrillation)
   - Presence of P mitrale – bifid or M shaped P waves in leads II, V1 – V6 (indicating left atrial enlargement)
   - Signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or ischaemia

2. **Transthoracic echocardiography**:
   - Used to diagnose mitral regurgitation and assess the severity of valve dysfunction
  
3. **Transoesophageal echocardiography**:
   - Indicated if the diagnosis remains unclear

4. **Cardiac catheterisation**:
   - Considered to check for coronary artery disease or assess pulmonary hypertension in patients with compromised ventricular function

## Management

### Pharmacological Treatment
- **ACE inhibitors**: e.g., captopril, enalapril, or lisinopril
- **Beta-blockers**: e.g., metoprolol, atenolol, or nadolol
- **Diuretics**: e.g., furosemide or indapamide, to reduce afterload in symptomatic patients

#### Indications for Pharmacological Treatment
- Asymptomatic with **left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) `>60%`** or **left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) `<45mm`**
- **Symptomatic** patients

**Post-surgical anticoagulation:** After surgical repair, patients may require warfarin, monitored to achieve a target INR of `2.5 to 3.5`.

### Non-Prescribing Management
**Surgical options include:**
- Valve repair (valvuloplasty or annuloplasty)
- Valve replacement:
  - **Mechanical valves**: Durable but require life-long anticoagulation
  - **Prosthetic valves**: Typically require anticoagulation for only 3 months
  
- **Emerging percutaneous options**

#### Indications for Surgery
- Asymptomatic with **LVEF `≤60%`** or **LVESD `≥45mm`**
- **Symptomatic** patients

*Note:* Surgery is not advisable for patients with symptomatic MR and **LVEF `<30%`**. In such cases, **intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation** may be considered as a supportive measure.

### Follow-Up
Patients are generally followed up **3-4 weeks** post-operatively with a baseline echocardiogram, followed by **annual monitoring** to ensure symptom resolution.

    question: "Which of the following symptoms is most commonly associated with left heart failure due to chronic mitral regurgitation?",
    options: [
      "Pitting edema in lower limbs",
      "Episodes of shortness of breath when lying flat",
      "Ascites",
      "Irregularly irregular pulse"

    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Orthopnea, or shortness of breath when lying flat, is a classic symptom associated with left heart failure and can be seen in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation as left ventricular dysfunction progresses.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about how left heart failure manifests in terms of symptoms. Which symptoms are linked specifically to pulmonary congestion versus systemic congestion?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old male presents with dyspnea on exertion and a pansystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals severe mitral regurgitation with left atrial enlargement. If surgical intervention becomes necessary, which of the following is a common indication for surgery in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Asymptomatic with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 60%",
      "Symptomatic with LVEF ≤ 60%",
      "Asymptomatic with LVESD < 45 mm",
      "Symptomatic with LVEF < 30%"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Patients who are symptomatic with an LVEF ≤ 60% are indicated for surgical intervention. This ensures timely management before further cardiac deterioration occurs.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the criteria that dictate when intervention becomes necessary in mitral regurgitation. What specific measures of left ventricular function indicate a more urgent need for treatment?"

    options: [
      "To reduce pulmonary congestion",
      "To alleviate symptoms of right heart failure",
      "To decrease heart rate and improve myocardial contractility",
      "To control arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Beta-blockers primarily help to decrease heart rate, which can alleviate myocardial oxygen demand and improve overall cardiac function in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the role of beta-blockers in heart failure management. Think about their effect on heart rate and myocardial workload—how does that tie into the underlying pathology of mitral regurgitation?"

    options: [
      "Presence of left atrial enlargement",
      "Sudden increase in left ventricular volume",

      "Biventricular hypertrophy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
