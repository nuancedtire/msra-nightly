# Understanding Mitral Regurgitation

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a type of valvular heart disease characterized by the backward flow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium due to an incompetent mitral valve. **Acute MR** often arises from conditions like infective endocarditis, papillary muscle dysfunction, rheumatic fever, or acute left ventricular dilatation secondary to ischemia. **Chronic MR** is typically linked to mitral valve prolapse (MVP) or thickening and elongation of the mitral apparatus, commonly seen in connective tissue disorders.

## Diagnosis

Patients with mild MR may not exhibit symptoms. However, as the left ventricle is strained, left heart failure (LHF) can develop, leading to increased left atrial pressure and pulmonary congestion. Common symptoms include:

- Gradually increasing **dyspnea** on exertion
- **Orthopnea**: Difficulty breathing while lying flat, often necessitating sleeping with multiple pillows or in an upright position
- **Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea**: Nighttime shortness of breath or coughing that disrupts sleep
- **Palpitations**: Increased heart rate to compensate for weak contractility, potentially leading to irregular rhythms
- **Hemoptysis**: Coughing up frothy pink sputum
- **Fatigue**

As LHF progresses, increased left atrial pressure may result in right heart failure (RHF) due to pulmonary hypertension. RHF symptoms include:

- **Peripheral edema**

### Clinical Signs

During a physical examination, the following signs may be evident:

- **Murmur**: Pansystolic, best heard at the apex (5th left intercostal space, midclavicular line) and radiating to the axilla
- **Displaced apex beat**: Lateral shift in chronic MR due to left ventricular dilatation
- **Signs of LHF**:
  - Irregularly irregular pulse (indicative of atrial fibrillation)
  - Coarse end-inspiratory crackles (pulmonary edema)
  - Loud P2 (pulmonary hypertension)
- **Signs of RHF**:
  - Pitting edema in lower limbs or sacrum (if bedridden)
  - Ascites
  - Raised jugular venous pressure (JVP)

## Investigations

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
  - Irregular rhythm with absent P waves (atrial fibrillation)
  - `P mitrale`: Bifid or M-shaped P waves in lead II, V1-V6 (indicating left atrial enlargement)
  - Signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia
- **Transthoracic echocardiography**:
  - Confirms MR diagnosis
  - Evaluates the severity of valve dysfunction
- **Transesophageal echocardiography**: Recommended if the diagnosis is uncertain
- **Cardiac catheterization**:
  - Assesses coronary artery disease risk in ischemic heart disease patients
  - Evaluates pulmonary hypertension in patients with poor ventricular function

## Management

### Pharmacological Treatment

Medications for MR patients include:

- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**: Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril
- **Beta-blockers**: Metoprolol, atenolol, nadolol

**Indications** for pharmacological treatment:

- Asymptomatic with `LVEF >60%` or `LVESD <45mm`
- Symptomatic patients

Diuretics, such as furosemide or indapamide, help reduce afterload in all symptomatic MR patients. Post-surgical repair of MR may require anticoagulation using warfarin, with a target INR of `2.5 to 3.5`, monitored every six weeks.

### Non-Pharmacological Management

Surgical interventions for MR:

- **Valve repair**: Valvuloplasty or annuloplasty
- **Valve replacement**:
  - **Mechanical valves**: Durable but necessitate lifelong anticoagulation with bleeding risks
  - **Prosthetic valves**: Reduced anticoagulation duration (usually 3 months) but may need replacement
- **Percutaneous options**: Emerging techniques

**Indications** for surgery:

- Asymptomatic with `LVEF ≤60%` or `LVESD ≥45mm`
- Symptomatic patients

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Surgery is not advised for symptomatic MR patients with `LVEF <30%`. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation may be considered to enhance forward flow and coronary artery perfusion.

**Post-operative Follow-up**: Patients should have a baseline echocardiogram 3-4 weeks post-operation, followed by annual monitoring to ensure symptom resolution.
