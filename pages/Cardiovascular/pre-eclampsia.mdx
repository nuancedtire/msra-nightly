# Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia: Overview and Management

Pre-eclampsia is pregnancy-induced hypertension associated with **proteinuria** (`>0.3 g` in 24 hours), with or without oedema. Left untreated, it can become **life-threatening** for both mother and fetus. Key characteristics include:

- **Maternal hypertension**
- **Proteinuria**
- **Oedema**
- **Intrauterine growth restriction**
- **Premature birth**

_Eclampsia_ occurs when these symptoms escalate to one or more **seizures**.

## Diagnosis

Pre-eclampsia occurs in roughly `0.5%` of pregnancies, while eclampsia occurs in `10%` of these cases. The death rate is extremely low, standing at `0.38` per `100,000` pregnancies.

### History

**Risk Factors**:

- **First pregnancy** or long time since last pregnancy
- **Increasing age**
- **BMI >35**
- **Family history**
- **Multiple pregnancies**
- **Comorbidities**:
  - Previous pre-eclampsia
  - Pre-existing hypertension
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Autoimmune disease

### Signs and Symptoms

Pre-eclampsia is defined by systolic BP `>140 mm Hg` or diastolic BP `>90 mm Hg` in the second half of pregnancy, along with `≥1+` proteinuria on urine dipstick.

- **New hypertension**
- **New and/or significant proteinuria**

**Severe pre-eclampsia** is characterized by:

- Diastolic BP `>110 mmHg` or systolic BP `>160 mmHg`
- Symptoms or biochemical and/or haematological impairment

**Features of severe pre-eclampsia** may include:

- Severe frontal headache
- Sudden swelling of face, hands, and feet
- Visual disturbances
- Epigastric pain or liver tenderness and/or vomiting
- Platelet count falling to below `100 x 10^9/L` (severe disease)
- Abnormal liver enzymes (ALT or AST rising to above `70 IU/L`)
- Clonus
- HELLP syndrome: Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets
- Papilloedema
- Foetal distress
- Growth restriction

_Approximately 45%_ of cases of eclampsia occur after delivery, most within four days postpartum, but can occur up to four weeks later.

### Investigations

- **Urinalysis**: Send for microscopy, culture, and sensitivities if proteinuria is present.
- **Frequent monitoring** of FBC, LFTs, renal function, electrolytes, and serum urate: To identify rising values and guide delivery timing.
- **HELLP syndrome**: Platelet count falling (`<100 x 10^9/L`), abnormal liver enzymes (ALT or AST `>70 IU/L`).
- **Clotting studies**: If there is severe pre-eclampsia or thrombocytopenia.
- **24-hour urine collections**: For protein quantification and creatinine clearance.
- **Ultrasound scan**: Assessment of foetal growth, amniotic fluid volume, and Doppler velocimetry of umbilical arteries.

_MRI or CT head is not indicated in uncomplicated eclampsia unless ruling out differential diagnoses._

## Management (Prescribing)

### Antihypertensive Treatment

- Start with **labetalol** (alternatives: **methyldopa** or **nifedipine**) to keep:
  - Systolic BP `<150 mm Hg`
  - Diastolic BP between `80-100 mm Hg`

**Consider treatment** in women with:
- Systolic BP `>160 mm Hg`
- Diastolic BP `>110 mm Hg`

Antihypertensive medications include:

- **Labetalol PO or IV**
- **Nifedipine PO**
- **Hydralazine IV**

**Note:** Antihypertensive medications should be continued after delivery, possibly for up to **three months**.

### Seizure Prevention

- **Magnesium sulfate** `4g` followed by an infusion pump over `5-10 minutes` for those at risk of eclampsia.

### Fluid Management

- Fluid restriction is advisable to reduce the risk of fluid overload in the intrapartum and postpartum periods.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Delivery of the placenta** is the only cure for pre-eclampsia.
- Conservative management until at least `34 weeks` if patients are hemodynamically stable and without coagulation abnormalities or HELLP syndrome.

### Monitoring Protocol

**Regular monitoring** and assessment of severity of high BP:

- **Mild**: `140-149/90-99 mm Hg`
  - Twice-weekly blood tests for FBC, electrolytes, renal function, and LFTs.
  
- **Moderate**: `150-159/100-109 mm Hg`
  - Blood tests three times per week.
  
- **Severe**: `≥160/110 mm Hg`
  - Blood tests three times per week.

**Ultrasound examinations** should assess foetal growth and amniotic fluid volume (with umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry) and cardiotocography whenever pre-eclampsia is diagnosed.

_Repeat cardiotocography_ is warranted if there are changes in foetal movements, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, or deterioration in maternal condition.

> **Delivery of the foetus and placenta must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, within a multidisciplinary process.**

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old woman at 30 weeks of gestation presents with a blood pressure of 162/104 mm Hg and proteinuria of 1+. She has a history of obesity (BMI 36) and this is her first pregnancy. Based on her condition, which of the following is the most appropriate initial management?",
    options: [
      "Start outpatient management with increased monitoring and dietary changes.",
      "Initiate antihypertensive therapy with labetalol.",
      "Admit for stabilization and initiate magnesium sulfate immediately.",
      "Schedule elective cesarean delivery at 34 weeks.",
      "Advise bed rest at home until delivery."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In this case, the patient has severe hypertension and proteinuria consistent with pre-eclampsia. The recommended initial treatment is to start antihypertensive therapy to manage her blood pressure and ensure safety for both the mother and the fetus. Labetalol is preferred, but immediate admission and magnesium sulfate would be for patients showing signs of imminent eclampsia.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Evaluate the severity of the blood pressure elevation and the immediate need for intervention. Consider what the guideline states regarding the management of high blood pressure in the context of pre-eclampsia."
  },
  {
    question: "In the management of a pregnant patient diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia, which of the following findings would indicate a worsening condition prompting immediate delivery?",
    options: [
      "Platelet count of 110 x 10^9/L.",
      "Transient proteinuria.",
      "Severe epigastric pain with elevated AST levels.",
      "Stable blood pressure below 150/100 mm Hg.",
      "Increased fetal movement reported by the mother."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Severe epigastric pain accompanied by elevated liver enzymes is a significant indicator of worsening pre-eclampsia and may suggest the presence of HELLP syndrome, warranting delivery.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the implications of elevated liver enzymes and symptoms such as epigastric pain. Think about what clinical signs and laboratory findings could indicate the need for immediate delivery in severe cases."
  },
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman at 35 weeks of gestation is diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and starts receiving magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. What is the most important monitoring parameter during her treatment?",
    options: [
      "Serum urate levels.",
      "Fetal heart rate monitoring.",
      "Deep tendon reflexes.",
      "Blood glucose levels.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! During magnesium sulfate treatment, it is crucial to monitor deep tendon reflexes as loss of reflexes can indicate magnesium toxicity, necessitating further management.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the purpose of magnesium sulfate in pre-eclampsia management and the necessary precautions during treatment. What specific signs of toxicity should clinicians observe for?"
  },
  {
    question: "A woman in her first pregnancy develops severe pre-eclampsia at 28 weeks of gestation. She is closely monitored but remains stable with treatment. What is the most appropriate plan for her management?",
    options: [
      "Deliver the baby immediately as there is no cure for pre-eclampsia.",
      "Continue conservative treatment until 34 weeks if she remains stable.",
      "Admit her for immediate cesarean section.",
      "Administer steroids for fetal lung maturity and prepare for delivery.",
      "Advise her to wait until labor starts naturally."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Conservative management can be appropriate until at least 34 weeks if the mother remains hemodynamically stable without signs of severe disease, balancing risks to maternal and fetal health.",
