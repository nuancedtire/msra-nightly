# Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia: A Comprehensive Overview

Pre-eclampsia is defined as pregnancy-induced hypertension along with proteinuria (`>0.3 g` in 24 hours), potentially accompanied by edema. If left untreated, it poses serious risks to both the mother and fetus. It is marked by maternal hypertension, proteinuria, edema, intrauterine growth restriction, and premature birth. Eclampsia occurs when these symptoms progress to include one or more seizures.

## Diagnosis

Pre-eclampsia affects approximately `0.5%` of pregnancies, with eclampsia occurring in `10%` of these cases. The mortality rate is notably low, at `0.38` per `100,000` pregnancies.

### History

**Risk Factors:**

- First pregnancy or prolonged interval since last pregnancy
- **Increasing age**
- **BMI >35**
- **Family history**
- **Multiple pregnancy**
- Comorbidities:
  - Previous pre-eclampsia
  - Pre-existing hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease

### Signs and Symptoms

Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed with a systolic BP `>140 mm Hg` or diastolic BP `>90 mm Hg` in the second half of pregnancy, accompanied by proteinuria (`≥1+` on urine dipstick).

- **New hypertension**
- **New and/or significant proteinuria**

**Severe Pre-eclampsia**: Diastolic BP `>110 mmHg` or systolic BP `>160 mmHg`, along with symptoms or biochemical/hematological impairment.

**Severe Pre-eclampsia Features:**

- Severe frontal headache
- Sudden swelling of face, hands, and feet
- Visual disturbances
- Epigastric pain, liver tenderness, and/or vomiting
- Platelet count falling below `100 x 10^9/L` (severe disease)
- Abnormal liver enzymes (ALT or AST `>70 IU/L`)
- Clonus
- HELLP syndrome (*Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets*)
- Papilloedema
- Fetal distress
- Growth restriction

Approximately `45%` of eclampsia cases occur postpartum, mostly within four days, but can extend up to four weeks later.

### Investigations

- **Urinalysis**: Send for microscopy, culture, and sensitivities if proteinuria is present.
- Frequent monitoring of FBC, LFTs, renal function, electrolytes, and serum urate to guide delivery timing. HELLP syndrome indicators include platelet count `<100 x 10^9/L` and abnormal liver enzymes (ALT or AST `>70 IU/L`).
- Clotting studies for severe pre-eclampsia or thrombocytopenia.
- 24-hour urine collections for protein quantification and creatinine clearance.
- **Ultrasound**: Assess fetal growth, amniotic fluid volume, and Doppler velocimetry of umbilical arteries.
- MRI or CT head is not typically indicated unless ruling out differential diagnoses.

## Management (Prescribing)

**Antihypertensive Treatment:**

- Initiate labetalol (or alternatives like methyldopa or nifedipine) to maintain systolic BP `<150 mm Hg` and diastolic BP between `80-100 mm Hg`.
- Consider treatment for systolic BP `>160 mm Hg` or diastolic BP `>110 mm Hg`. For women with additional markers, consider treatment at lower hypertension levels:
  - Labetalol PO or IV
  - Nifedipine PO
  - Hydralazine IV
- Continue antihypertensive medication post-delivery as dictated by BP, potentially up to three months.

**Seizure Prevention:**

- Administer Magnesium sulfate `4g` via infusion pump over `5-10 minutes` for eclampsia risk.

**Fluid Balance:**

- Restrict fluids to reduce the risk of overload during intrapartum and postpartum periods.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

**Delivery** is the only definitive cure for pre-eclampsia. Conservative management is possible until at least 34 weeks if the patient is stable, without coagulation abnormalities, and in the absence of HELLP.

<details>
<summary>Monitoring and Assessment</summary>

- Regular monitoring of high BP severity:
  - **Mild**: `140-149/90-99 mm Hg` - Twice-weekly blood tests for FBC, electrolytes, renal function, and LFTs.
  - **Moderate**: `150-159/100-109 mm Hg` - Blood tests three times a week.
  - **Severe**: `≥160/110 mm Hg` - Blood tests three times a week.
- Perform ultrasound to assess fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume, with umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry, and cardiotocography with any diagnosis of pre-eclampsia.
- Repeat cardiotocography with changes in fetal movements, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, or maternal condition deterioration.

</details>

**Delivery Management** is case-specific, requiring a multidisciplinary approach.

  {
    question: "A 28-year-old woman, G1P0, at 30 weeks of gestation, presents with a severe frontal headache and visual disturbances. Her blood pressure is 170/110 mmHg, and urinalysis shows 2+ proteinuria. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management step?",
    options: [
      "Start oral methyldopa",
      "Administer IV labetalol",
      "Administer magnesium sulfate",
      "Perform an emergency cesarean section",
      "Restrict fluid intake"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! IV labetalol is used to rapidly control severe hypertension in pre-eclampsia to prevent complications such as stroke. Once blood pressure is stabilized, further management can be considered.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the immediate need to control severe hypertension to prevent maternal complications. Magnesium sulfate is for seizure prevention, not blood pressure control."
  },
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman with a history of chronic hypertension is 28 weeks pregnant. She presents with new onset hypertension and proteinuria. Her platelet count is 90 x 10^9/L, and her liver enzymes are elevated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Gestational hypertension",
      "Chronic hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia",
      "Severe pre-eclampsia",
      "HELLP syndrome",
      "Eclampsia"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of new onset hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes indicates severe pre-eclampsia, which can progress to HELLP syndrome if untreated.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the diagnostic criteria for severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. The platelet count and liver enzyme levels are key indicators."
  },
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman, G2P1, at 34 weeks of gestation, is diagnosed with pre-eclampsia. Her blood pressure is controlled with oral labetalol, and she is stable. What is the most definitive treatment for her condition?",
    options: [
      "Continued monitoring and antihypertensive therapy",
      "Administration of magnesium sulfate",
      "Delivery of the fetus",
      "IV hydralazine administration",
      "Increased fluid intake"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Delivery is the only definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia. If the mother and fetus are stable, delivery can be planned to ensure safety.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While antihypertensive therapy and magnesium sulfate are crucial in management, they do not cure pre-eclampsia. Consider what ultimately resolves the condition."

    correctFeedback: "Correct! Liver function tests are crucial to identify severe pre-eclampsia, particularly with symptoms of epigastric pain, which may indicate liver involvement.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While urinalysis and other tests are important, liver function tests specifically address the concern of severe pre-eclampsia with liver involvement."
