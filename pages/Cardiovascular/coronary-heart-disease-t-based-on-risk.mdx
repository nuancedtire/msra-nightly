# Understanding Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most prevalent cardiovascular condition caused by the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries. This article explores the risk factors, prevention strategies, risk assessment, treatment options, and emergency management of CAD.

## Risk Factors

CAD risk factors are classified into non-modifiable and modifiable categories:

- **Non-modifiable:**
  - Gender (male)
  - Family history of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)
  - Ethnic background (e.g., South Asians)
  - Age `>50 years`

- **Modifiable:**
  - Hypertension
  - Dyslipidaemia
  - Obesity
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety, social isolation)
  - Low physical activity
  - Unhealthy diet
  - Smoking
  - Excessive alcohol intake

If left untreated, CAD can weaken the heart muscle, leading to stable or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

## Prevention

Educating patients on lifestyle changes is crucial for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular incidents. This should be emphasized regularly, especially for individuals with a 10-year risk of `≥10%`.

### Suggested Lifestyle Changes:
- **Balanced, healthy diet**
- **Regular physical activity**
- **Smoking cessation**
- **Limited alcohol intake**

Additionally, all patients should undergo investigation, diagnosis, and management of cardiovascular and other comorbid conditions such as hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke/TIA, and obesity.

## Risk Assessment

CVD risk assessments are recommended for all patients `>40 years` with no previous CVD history at least every 5 years. This also applies to patients with a family history of premature atherosclerotic CVD or familial dyslipidaemia, regardless of age.

- **SCORE Risk Chart:** Estimates the 10-year risk of death due to fatal cardiovascular incidents based on gender, age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and smoking status for patients with no prior CVD history.
  
- **QRISK®2 and JBS3 Risk Calculators:** Used for patients with a history of CVD and other comorbidities. These tools consider factors such as lipid profile, systolic blood pressure, gender, age, ethnicity, smoking status, BMI, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, treated hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, social deprivation, and a family history of premature CVD.

## Treatment

### Primary Prevention:

- **Anti-platelet therapy:** *Not recommended*
- **Anti-hypertension medications:** For high-risk patients with BP `>140/90mmHg`. In low-risk patients with type I hypertension (`140-159/90-99mmHg`), lifestyle changes might be considered before medication.
- **Statins:** Low-dose atorvastatin for patients with `≥10%` risk of developing CVD, all patients with chronic kidney disease, and those with a history of `>10 years` of diabetes.

### Secondary Prevention:

- **Anti-platelet therapy:** Aspirin `75mg` for all patients.
- **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT):** Aspirin `75mg` + clopidogrel `75mg` (or prasugrel/ticagrelor) for 12 months post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS). After 12 months, discontinue for low-risk patients; continue for high-risk patients (aspirin + ticagrelor or rivaroxaban).
- **Statins:** Atorvastatin `80 mg` for all patients. If poorly tolerated, switch to an alternative statin.
- **ACEI:** For all patients.
- **Anti-hypertensive therapy:** Aim for BP `<130/80mmHg` in high-risk patients, using at least two drugs (ACEI + Ca2+ inhibitor or beta-blocker). If ACEI is contraindicated or not tolerated, switch to an ARB.
- **Beta-blockers (atenolol, bisoprolol):** Up to 12 months post-significant anterior wall damage. Continue for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and to prevent chest pain in stable angina.

### Symptom Management:

- **Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) sublingual:** For patients with stable angina to manage acute chest pain.
- **Beta-blockers:** For patients with tachycardia (goal HR: `60-70 bpm`). If tachycardia persists, increase the dose or switch to dihydropyridine. For stable angina, if contraindicated, use verapamil or diltiazem.
- **Nicorandil, ranolazine, ivabradine:** If symptoms persist or worsen, or if beta-blockers and Ca2+-blockers are contraindicated (monotherapy) or insufficient (polytherapy).

### Surgical Management:

- **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**
- **Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)**

## Emergencies

CAD can remain stable for long periods, but if a plaque ruptures or erodes, it can lead to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients may present with:

- Ischaemic chest pain and anxiety
- Low/high blood pressure
- Arrhythmia
- Raised jugular vein pressure (JVP)
- Peripheral oedema (lower limbs)
- New heart murmur
- Crackles at the lung bases
- Increased respiratory rate
- Pale, sweaty, clammy, and in discomfort

A **12-lead ECG** should be performed, and cardiac troponins ordered for diagnosis. If a STEMI (ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction) is confirmed on the ECG, treatment should not wait for troponin results.

### Management of Full-thickness MI:

- **Initial Management:**
  - Morphine or diamorphine hydrochloride + antiemetic
  - Oxygen
  - Aspirin `150-300mg` + clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor + heparin
  - Nitrates - sublingual glyceryl trinitrate; if pain persists, intravenous glyceryl trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate
  - Consider beta-blockers (as soon as possible if not contraindicated) and ACEI (within 24h if not contraindicated)

- **Reperfusion Therapy:**
  - **PCI:** Preferred method with stent placement (drug-eluting stent=DES). Patients should undergo the procedure within `60-120min` of first medical intervention.
  - **Thrombolytic Therapy:** If PCI is not feasible within `90min`, start within `30min` of the myocardial infarction, using a thrombolytic drug (e.g., alteplase) + heparin.
  - **CABG:** Consider if PCI and/or thrombolytic therapy are unsuccessful and for patients with cardiac shock and multiple vessel coronary artery disease.

- **Post-ACS Treatment:**
  - High-dose statin and ACEI for all patients post-ACS (if not contraindicated).
  - Dual anti-platelet therapy: Aspirin `75mg` for life + clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor for 12 months.
  - Consider beta-blockers.
  - Recommend cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes.
