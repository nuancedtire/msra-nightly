# Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease, characterized by the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries.

## Risk Factors

### Non-modifiable Risk Factors:
| Factor                   |
|--------------------------|
| Gender (male)            |
| Family history of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) |
| Ethnic background (e.g. South Asians) |
| Age `>50 years`            |

### Modifiable Risk Factors:
| Factor                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| Hypertension                                      |
| Dyslipidaemia                                    |
| Obesity                                          |
| Diabetes mellitus                                 |
| Psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety, social isolation) |
| Low physical activity                             |
| Unhealthy diet                                    |
| Smoking                                          |
| Excessive alcohol intake                         |

Untreated CAD can lead to serious health complications including **stable or unstable angina**, **myocardial infarction**, **heart failure**, and **arrhythmias**.

## Prevention

Patient education on lifestyle changes is crucial for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular incidents, especially for patients with a 10-year risk of 10% or more. Suggested lifestyle changes include:

- **Balanced, healthy diet**
- **Regular physical activity**
- **Smoking cessation**
- **Limited alcohol intake**

### Investigation and Management

All patients should undergo investigation, diagnosis, and management of cardiovascular and other comorbidities such as:

- Hypertension
- Peripheral arterial disease
- Diabetes
- Chronic kidney disease
- Stroke/TIA
- Obesity

## Risk Assessment

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessments should be offered to all patients `>40 years` with no past medical history of CVD at least every 5 years, and for those with a family history of premature atherosclerotic CVD or familial dyslipidaemia, regardless of age.

### Risk Assessment Tools:

- **SCORE Risk Chart**: Estimates the 10-year risk of death due to fatal cardiovascular incidents based on:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Systolic blood pressure
  - Total cholesterol
  - Smoking status

- **QRISK®2 and JBS3 risk calculators**: For patients with a past medical history of CVD and other comorbidities, factors include:
  - Lipid profile
  - Systolic blood pressure
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Ethnicity
  - Smoking status
  - BMI
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Atrial fibrillation
  - Treated hypertension
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Social deprivation
  - Family history of premature CVD

## Treatment

### Primary Prevention
- **Anti-platelet therapy**: NOT recommended
- **Anti-hypertension medications**: For all high-risk patients with BP >140/90 mmHg; lifestyle changes may be sufficient for low-risk patients with type I hypertension (140-159/90-99 mmHg).
- **Statins**: Low-dose atorvastatin for patients with ≥10% risk of developing CVD, all patients with chronic kidney disease, and those with a history of diabetes >10 years.

### Secondary Prevention
- **Anti-platelet therapy**: Aspirin 75 mg for all patients
- **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)**: Aspirin 75 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg (or prasugrel/ticagrelor) for 12 months after acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
  - Discontinue after 12 months for low-risk patients; continue for high-risk patients.
- **Statins**: Atorvastatin 80 mg for all patients (switch to alternative statin if badly tolerated).
- **ACE inhibitors (ACEI)**: Prescribed for all patients.
- **Anti-hypertensive therapy**: Aim for BP `<130/80 mmHg` in high-risk patients; often at least 2 drugs (ACEI + Ca2+ inhibitor or beta-blocker).
  - Switch to ARB if ACEI is contraindicated or not tolerated.
- **Beta-blockers**: For up to 12 months after significant anterior wall damage. After 12 months, continue for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and those requiring chest pain control in stable angina.

### Symptom Management
- **Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN)**: Sublingual for stable angina patients to manage acute chest pain.
- **Beta-blockers**: For patients with tachycardia (goal HR: `60-70 bpm`). If tachycardia persists, increase dose or switch to dihydropyridine.
- **Alternative medications**: Nicorandil, ranolazine, ivabradine for persistent symptoms or contraindications to beta-blockers and Ca2+-blockers.

### Surgical Management
- **Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**
- **Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)**

## Emergencies

Although coronary artery disease may have long stable periods, plaque rupture or erosion can lead to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients may present with:

- Ischaemic chest pain and anxiety
- Low/high blood pressure
- Arrhythmia
- Raised jugular vein pressure (JVP)
- Peripheral oedema (lower limbs)
- New heart murmur
- Crackles at lung bases
- Increased respiratory rate
- Pale, sweaty, clammy appearance, and discomfort

In case of suspected STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction), a **12-lead ECG** should be performed immediately, and cardiac troponins ordered. Treatment should not be delayed while waiting for troponin results.

### Initial Management of Full-Thickness MI:
1. **Morphine or diamorphine hydrochloride + antiemetic**
2. **Oxygen**
3. **Aspirin 150-300 mg + clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor + heparin**
4. **Nitrates**: Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate; consider intravenous therapies if pain persists.
5. **Beta-blockers**: Initiate as soon as possible if not contraindicated.
6. **ACEI**: Consider within 24 hours if not contraindicated.

### Reperfusion Therapy Options
- **PCI**: Preferred method, with stent placement (drug-eluting stent=DES) within `60-120 min` of first medical intervention.
- **Thrombolytic Therapy**: If PCI is not feasible within `90 min`, to be started within `30 min` of myocardial infarction (e.g., alteplase + heparin).
- **CABG**: Consider if PCI and/or thrombolytic therapy are unsuccessful, especially for patients with cardiac shock and multivessel coronary artery disease.

### Post-ACS Treatment
- **High-dose statin** and **ACEI** for all patients post-ACS (if not contraindicated).
- **Dual anti-platelet therapy**: Aspirin `75 mg` for life + clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor for 12 months.
- **Beta-blockers**: Consider in the post-ACS setting.
- **Cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes** are strongly recommended.

    question: "A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents for a routine check-up. He has a family history of coronary artery disease and mentions he sometimes experiences chest discomfort during intense exercise. What is the most appropriate initial investigation to assess his cardiovascular risk?",
    options: [
      "Lipid panel",
      "Treadmill stress test",
      "12-lead ECG",
      "Coronary angiography",
      "SCORE Risk Chart assessment"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The SCORE Risk Chart assessment is the best initial step for evaluating cardiovascular risk in this patient, especially considering his age and family history of coronary artery disease. The other options may be useful later but are not the most appropriate first step for risk assessment.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the importance of assessing risk factors before considering more invasive or specific tests. In this case, what method might provide a comprehensive risk assessment using demographic and lifestyle data?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient presents to the emergency department with chest pain, and an ECG reveals ST-segment elevation in V1 to V4. What is the most appropriate immediate management step for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Administer high-dose statin",
      "Initiate beta-blocker therapy",
      "Perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)",
      "Start thrombolytic therapy",
      "Place the patient on long-term dual antiplatelet therapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The most appropriate immediate management for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if it's feasible. This is crucial for restoring blood flow and minimizing heart damage.",
