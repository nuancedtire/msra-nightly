# Understanding Electrocardiography (ECG)

Electrocardiography is a diagnostic tool that visualizes the heart's electrical activity over time. It assists in interpreting cardiac rhythms and identifying abnormalities such as myocardial ischemia and infarction, arrhythmias, electrolyte imbalances, and hypertrophy. The most common form is the 12-lead electrocardiogram.

## Technique

In a standard 12-lead ECG, the patient should lie in a supine position. Ten electrodes are used: six precordial leads and four limb leads, arranged as follows:

![ECG Electrode Placement](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG1.png)

- `V1`: 4th intercostal space, right sternal edge
- `V2`: 4th intercostal space, left sternal edge
- `V3`: Between `V2` and `V4`
- `V4`: 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line
- `V5`: Anterior axillary line, same level as `V4`
- `V6`: Midaxillary line, same level as `V4` and `V5`

## Describing ECG

![ECG Analysis](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG2.png)

### Rate

- **Normal:** `60-100 bpm`
- For regular rhythm, measure the distance between two consecutive P-waves (atrial rate) and R-waves (ventricular rate). 
  - On `25 mm/s` paper, divide `1500` by the R-R interval (in small squares).
  - On `50 mm/s` paper, divide `3000` by the R-R interval.
- For irregular rhythm, count the QRS complexes in a `6-second strip` and multiply by `10`.

### Rhythm

- **Types:** Sinus, atrial, or ventricular rhythm.
- **Normal Sinus Rhythm:**
  - Regular, `60-100 bpm`
  - P wave precedes each QRS complex, is regular, `0.06-0.12s`, positive in leads I, II, aVF, and V2-V6; negative in aVR, amplitude `≤3mm`
- **QRS Complexes:** Consistent shape, duration `<0.12s`
- **PR Intervals:** `0.12-0.2s`
- **T Wave:** Upright, round in leads I and II, amplitude `0.5 mm` in leads I, II, III; up to `10mm` in precordial leads
- **QT Intervals:** Typically `0.38-0.42s`

### Axis

- **Normal:** Between `-30` to `+90`
- **Left Deviation:** `<-30`
- **Right Deviation:** `>+90`
- **Assessment:** Evaluate net QRS deflection in leads I and aVF. If both are positive, the axis is normal. If lead I is positive and aVF is negative, it's left-deviated. If lead I is negative and aVF is positive, it's right-deviated. If both are negative, the axis is indeterminate.

## Abnormal ECG

### Sinus Rhythm Abnormalities

- **Sinus Tachycardia:** Normal P wave and PR interval, rate `>100 bpm`
- **Sinus Bradycardia:** Normal P wave and PR interval, rate `<60 bpm`

### Other Rhythms

#### Atrial Fibrillation (AF)

![AF](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG3.png)

- Irregular rhythm, absent P waves replaced by uneven baseline F waves, irregularly irregular QRS complexes
- **Ventricular Rate:** `>100 bpm` (uncontrolled AF), `<100 bpm` (controlled AF)
- **Atrial Rate:** `>400 bpm`
- T waves, PR, and QT intervals not discernible

#### Atrial Flutter (AFl)

![AFl](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG4.png)

- Regular rhythm, atrial rate `250-400 bpm`
- Abnormal P waves with "saw-toothed" F waves

#### Ventricular Tachycardia

![Ventricular Tachycardia](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG5.png)

- Wide, regular QRS complexes `>0.12s`, ventricular rate `100-250 bpm`
- P waves not discernible
- If pulseless, it's a shockable rhythm requiring defibrillation

#### Ventricular Fibrillation

![Ventricular Fibrillation](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG6.png)

- Wide, irregular QRS `>0.12s`, chaotic rapid rhythm
- P waves not discernible
- Shockable rhythm needing defibrillation

#### Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome

![WPW](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG7.png)

- Wide QRS `>0.12s`, shortened PR interval `<0.12s`, slurred R wave (delta wave)
- Diagnosis requires a history of confirmed tachyarrhythmia episodes

### Blocks

![Blocks](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG8.png)

- **RBBB (Right Bundle Branch Block):** Wide QRS `>0.12s`, rsR’ waves with T-wave inversion in V1, widened S waves with positive T waves in V6
- **LBBB (Left Bundle Branch Block):** Wide QRS `>0.12s`, wide, deep S wave in V1, slurred, wide R wave with T-wave inversion in V6, often elevated ST segments in V1-V4

![AV Block](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ECG9-714x1024.png)

- **1st Degree AV Block:** Regular rhythm, PR `>0.2s`, normal P waves and QRS complexes
- **2nd Degree AV Block Type I (Mobitz I/Wenckebach):** Regular atrial rhythm with longer PR intervals until a P wave without a QRS complex appears ("missed beat"), then repeats
- **2nd Degree AV Block Type II (Mobitz II):** Regular atrial rhythm with missed QRS complexes at a fixed ratio; may progress to complete block
- **3rd Degree AV Block (Complete Heart Block):** Regular atrial and ventricular rhythms with no relationship, independent P waves and QRS complexes; ventricular rhythm depends on impulse origin (AV node `40-60 bpm`, Purkinje system `<40 bpm`)

### Hypertrophy

- **Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH):** Sum of S wave in V1/V2 and R wave in V5/V6/aVR `≥35mm` or R wave `≥12mm` in aVL
- **Right Atrial Hypertrophy:** Positive P wave `>3mm` in I/II/III leads (P pulmonale)
- **Left Atrial Hypertrophy:** Negative P wave `>1mm` in V1 lead (P cardiale)

### Metabolic Disturbance

- **Hypokalemia:** Flattened T wave, prominent U waves, peaked P waves
- **Hyperkalemia:** Peaked T wave, widened QRS, flattened or absent P waves
- **Hypercalcemia:** Shortened QT interval
- **Hypocalcemia:** Prolonged QT interval, small T waves

### Myocardial Infarction

- **Typical Findings:**
  - Peaked T wave
  - ST elevation in 2 contiguous leads: `>1.5-2.5mm` in V2-V3 and `>1mm` in other leads

#### Reciprocal Change

- ST depression `>0.5mm` in two contiguous leads
  - **Location of Ischemia Based on ECG Changes:**
    - V1-V4: Anteroseptal
      - V1-V2: Septum, right atrium
      - V3-V4: Anterior wall (left ventricle)
    - V5-V6, I, aVL: Lateral wall (left ventricle)
    - II, III, aVF: Inferior wall (left ventricle)
    - rV3-rV4: Right ventricle
