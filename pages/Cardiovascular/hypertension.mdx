# Hypertension: Diagnosis and Management

Hypertension is characterized by a *systolic blood pressure (SBP)* of `≥140 mmHg` and/or a *diastolic blood pressure (DBP)* of `≥90 mmHg`. It is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events, responsible for about 50% of cardiovascular deaths. 

## Types of Hypertension

### Primary Hypertension

- Accounts for 95% of hypertension cases.
- The exact cause is unknown and is believed to be due to a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors.

### Secondary Hypertension

- Makes up 5% of cases.
- Commonly caused by renal disease.

**Causes of Secondary Hypertension:**

- **Renal Disease:** Glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic sclerosis, chronic pyelonephritis, polycystic kidneys, renovascular disease (e.g., atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia).
- **Endocrine Diseases:** Primary aldosteronism disorders, Cushing’s syndrome, phaeochromocytoma, acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism.
- **Pregnancy**
- **Drugs:** Steroids, MAO inhibitors, oral contraceptives, cocaine, amphetamines.

## Risk Factors

- Age
- Tobacco smoking
- Obesity
- High sodium, low potassium diet
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Physical inactivity
- Chronic illnesses: sleep apnea, kidney disease, diabetes
- Pregnancy

## Diagnosis

Most individuals with primary hypertension are asymptomatic and are diagnosed during routine check-ups. Some might experience headaches, sleep disturbances, light-headedness, vertigo, or tinnitus, although these symptoms are not more frequent compared to the general population. Symptoms related to underlying conditions may indicate secondary hypertension or complications from sustained high blood pressure.

**Diagnostic Tools:**

- **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) or Home BP Monitoring (HBPM):** Recommended for patients with a clinic pressure of `≥140/90 mmHg` to confirm hypertension and exclude white-coat or nocturnal hypertension.
- **Diagnosis Confirmation:** Daytime average of ABPM or HBPM `≥135/85 mmHg`.

**Blood Pressure Measurement Guidelines:**

- Cuff width should be `>40%` of the arm circumference.
- Ensure the cuff is secured tightly around the arm.
- Arm should be outstretched, positioned horizontally at heart-level, and well-supported.
- Measure blood pressure on both arms.
- Avoid using automated devices if pulse irregularity is present.

## Investigations

Before confirming a diagnosis of hypertension, secondary causes should be excluded. Evaluate patients for end-organ damage to assess severity and calculate cardiovascular risk using tools like the JBS3 Risk Calculator or QRISK®3-2018.

**Tests to Consider:**

- **ECG or ECHO:** Detects left ventricular hypertrophy or past myocardial infarction.
- **Urine Analysis:** Checks for proteinuria, blood, meta-adrenaline (phaeochromocytoma), free cortisol (Cushing’s syndrome).
- **Renal Ultrasound or Arteriography:** Assesses renal artery stenosis.
- **U&E:** Identifies hypokalaemia (Conn’s syndrome), hypercalcemia (hyperparathyroidism).
- **Ophthalmoscopy:** Evaluates for retinopathy.
- **Blood Tests:** Includes total serum cholesterol, HDL and LDL levels, and fasting glucose to calculate cardiovascular risk.

## Management of Hypertensive Emergencies

**Malignant Hypertension** is characterized by severely elevated blood pressure `≥180/120 mmHg` with end-organ failure due to vascular damage. Symptoms include retinal hemorrhage and/or optic nerve swelling (papilloedema).

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Blood pressure should not be reduced too quickly to avoid ischemic damage. Aim for a mean BP reduction of 10-20% within the first hour, followed by a 5-15% reduction over the next 24 hours.
</Callout>

- **Oral Medications:** Preferred for most cases.
- **Intravenous Medications:** Such as labetalol or sodium nitroprusside, recommended for encephalopathy or congestive heart failure.
- **Avoid Sublingual Nifedipine:** Rapid BP decrease may lead to stroke.

## Management (Prescribing)

The general target is to reduce blood pressure to `<140/90 mmHg`. For patients `>80 years`, the target is `150/90 mmHg`, and for those with diabetes, it is `<130/80 mmHg`. Treatment plans should be personalized.

### Monotherapy

- Patients `≥55 years` and black patients of any age: Use **Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB)** or thiazides.
- Patients `<55 years` with comorbidities (e.g., LVF, diabetes, proteinuria): Use **ACE Inhibitors (ACEI)** or ARBs if ACEI is not tolerated.
- Women of child-bearing potential, or those intolerant to ACEI and AEB, or with increased sympathetic drive: Consider **Beta-blockers**.

### Multi-Drug Therapy

Recommended if hypertension remains uncontrolled despite patient compliance and adequate dosages:

1. ACEI or ARB + CCB or thiazides  
2. ACEI or ARB + CCB + thiazides  
3. ACEI or ARB + CCB + thiazides + spironolactone

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Encourage lifestyle modifications:

- Quit smoking.
- Reduce alcohol intake.
- Adopt a low-fat, low-sodium, high-potassium diet.
- Engage in regular physical activity.
- Lose weight if overweight or obese.

*Lifestyle changes should be recommended to all patients with diagnosed or suspected hypertension. They may sufficiently manage stage 1 hypertension* (clinic BP `140/90 mmHg-159/99 mmHg` and HBPM or ABPM `135/85 mmHg-149/94 mmHg`) *without comorbidities and a 10-year cardiovascular risk of <10%.*
