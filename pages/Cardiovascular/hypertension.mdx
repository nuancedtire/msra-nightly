# Hypertension: Diagnosis and Management

Hypertension is a condition defined as a **systolic blood pressure (SBP)** of `≥140 mmHg` and/or a **diastolic blood pressure (DBP)** of `≥90 mmHg`. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular incidents, leading to approximately **50% of all cardiovascular deaths**. 

## Types of Hypertension

- **Primary Hypertension**: Accounts for 95% of cases; the cause is unknown but involves complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors.
- **Secondary Hypertension**: Constitutes 5% of cases. The most common cause is **renal disease**.

### Causes of Secondary Hypertension

- **Renal Diseases**:
  - Glomerulonephritis (most common cause)
  - Polyarteritis nodosa
  - Systemic sclerosis
  - Chronic pyelonephritis
  - Polycystic kidneys
  - Renovascular disease (atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia)
  
- **Endocrine Diseases**:
  - Primary aldosteronism disorders (most common cause)
  - Cushing’s syndrome
  - Phaeochromocytoma
  - Acromegaly
  - Hyperparathyroidism
  
- **Other Causes**:
  - Pregnancy
  - Drugs: steroids, MAOI, oral contraception, cocaine, amphetamines

### Risk Factors

- **Age**
- **Smoking Tobacco**
- **Obesity**
- **Diet**: high in sodium and low in potassium
- **Excessive Alcohol Consumption**
- **Lack of Physical Activity**
- **Chronic Illnesses**: sleep apnea, kidney disease, diabetes
- **Pregnancy**

## Diagnosis

Most patients suffering from primary hypertension are **asymptomatic**, and the diagnosis is typically made during regular screenings. Symptoms may include:

- Headaches
- Sleep disturbances
- Light-headedness
- Vertigo
- Tinnitus

However, these symptoms are not more common than in the general population. To confirm diagnosis:

- **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)** or
- **Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM)** should be ordered for patients with clinic pressure `≥140/90 mmHg`.

**Diagnosis is confirmed if** the daytime average of ABPM or HBPM is `≥135/85 mmHg`.

### Blood Pressure Measurement Rules

- The **cuff width** must be `>40%` of arm circumference.
- The cuff should be secured tightly around the arm.
- Arm must be outstretched, positioned horizontally at heart level.
- Blood pressure should be measured on both arms.
- Automated devices should not be used if pulse irregularity is present.

## Investigations

To manage hypertension effectively, it is essential to **exclude secondary causes** and assess **end-organ damage**. Consider the following investigations:

| Investigation               | Purpose                                     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **ECG or ECHO**            | Left ventricular hypertrophy, past MI      |
| **Urine Analysis**         | Proteinuria, blood in urine, metanephrines |
| **Renal Ultrasound**       | Check for renal artery stenosis             |
| **U&E**                    | Hypokalaemia (Conn’s syndrome), hypercalcemia |
| **Ophthalmoscopy**         | Detect retinopathy                          |
| **Lipid and Glucose Levels**| Calculate cardiovascular risk               |

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

**Malignant Hypertension** (hypertensive crisis; accelerated hypertension) is defined as severely elevated blood pressure of `≥180/120 mmHg` with either new onset or progression of end-organ failure.

### Key Points for Management

- Patients usually present with **retinal hemorrhage** and/or **swelling of the optic nerve** (papilloedema).
- Blood pressure should not be reduced too quickly; a maximum of **20% reduction** in mean blood pressure is recommended within the first hour, followed by a **5-15% reduction** over the next 24 hours.
- Generally, **oral medications** should be used, while **intravenous medications** (e.g. labetalol, sodium nitroprusside) are recommended in cases of encephalopathy or congestive cardiac failure.
- **Sublingual nifedipine** is contraindicated due to the risk of rapid blood pressure decrease leading to stroke.

## Management (Prescribing)

The goal is to reduce blood pressure to `<140/90 mmHg`, with specific targets for certain populations:

- **Patients aged `>80 years`:** Target BP is `150/90 mmHg`
- **Patients with diabetes:** Target BP is `<130/80 mmHg`

### Monotherapy Options

1. **`≥55 years` and `black patients`** (regardless of age):
   - **Calcium channel blockers (CCB)** (e.g. nifedipine) or **thiazides** (e.g. chlortalidone)
   
2. **`<55 years`** or patients with comorbidities (LVF, diabetes, proteinuria):
   - **ACE inhibitors (ACEI)** (e.g. lisinopril) or **ARBs** (if ACEI not tolerated; e.g. candesartan)
   
3. **Women of child-bearing potential**, those intolerant or with contradictions to ACEI/ARB, or patients with increased sympathetic drive:
   - **Beta-blockers** (e.g. bisoprolol) may be considered.

### Multi-Drug Therapy

This is recommended if hypertension remains uncontrolled despite compliance and adequate dosage:

1. Start with: **ACEI or ARB + CCB or thiazides**
2. Adjust to: **ACEI or ARB + CCB + thiazides**
3. Final option: **ACEI or ARB + CCB + thiazides + spironolactone**

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

**Lifestyle Interventions**: Encourage patients to:

- Quit smoking
- Reduce alcohol intake
- Follow a low-fat, low-sodium, high-potassium diet
- Engage in regular physical activity
- Achieve a healthy weight

**Periodic lifestyle advice** should be offered to all patients with diagnosed or suspected hypertension. Lifestyle modifications can manage hypertension effectively for patients with stage 1 hypertension (`clinic BP 140/90 mmHg - 159/99 mmHg` and `HBPM or ABPM 135/85 mmHg - 149/94 mmHg`) without the immediate use of antihypertensive drugs.
