# Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to a continuum of disease characterized by acute ischaemia or infarction of the myocardium. There are three types of ACS:

- **Unstable Angina (UA)**: Defined as evidence of myocardial damage (e.g., chest pain at rest) without changes to cardiac biomarkers.
- **Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)**: Marked by evidence of myocardial damage with elevated cardiac biomarkers but no ST elevation on ECG, indicating a partial-thickness infarct.
- **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)**: Shows evidence of myocardial damage with elevated cardiac biomarkers and persistent ST elevation on ECG, representing a full-thickness infarct.

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors

Risk factors for ACS can be categorized into:
  
- **Modifiable:**
  - Smoking
  - Type 2 diabetes
  - Hypertension
  - Hypercholesterolaemia
  - Obesity
  - Sedentary lifestyle
  - Cocaine use

- **Non-Modifiable:**
  - Increasing age
  - Male gender
  - Family history

### Symptoms of ACS

The symptoms of ACS may include:

- Central or left-sided **"crushing" chest pain** (may radiate to jaw or left arm)
- Shortness of breath
- Sweating
- Nausea & Vomiting

- *Dyspepsia*
- *Absence of chest pain* especially in females, diabetics, or the elderly.

### Physical Examination

Few physical signs can be elicited in patients with ACS.

## Investigations

### Bedside Investigations

- Basic observations
- Serial ECGs: 
  - **STEMI**: ST-elevation in certain leads depending on area of infarction.
  - **NSTEMI or UA**: T-wave inversion or ST-depression.
  - Continuous ECG changes suggest an evolving myocardial infarction.

#### Myocardial Ischaemia by Heart Territory

| Heart Territory | Coronary Artery                                       | Leads Showing Ischaemic Changes          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Lateral         | Left circumflex artery                               | I, aVL, V5, V6                           |
| Anteroseptal    | Left anterior descending artery                       | V1 – V4                                  |
| Inferior        | Posterior descending artery (RCA in 80%, LCX in 20%)| II, III, aVF                             |
| Posterior       | Posterior descending artery (RCA in 80%, LCX in 20%)| Reciprocal changes: prominent R waves, flat ST depression, T wave inversion in V1-V4|

### Blood Tests

- **Cardiac markers**: Serial troponin is commonly tested.
  - Elevated in NSTEMI and STEMI `4-6 hours` after injury and remains elevated for up to `10 days`.
  - CK-MB and myoglobin can also be measured.
- FBC (to check for anaemia)
- U&E (to identify potential hyperkalaemia causing arrhythmias)
- Blood glucose and lipid profile to assess risk factors.

### Imaging

- **Coronary Angiogram**: Diagnostic investigation of choice.
- **Erect Chest X-ray**: To exclude pneumothorax.
- **Echocardiogram (ECHO)**: To assess heart function.

## Management of Emergencies Related to ACS

As in any emergency, an **ABCDE approach** should be taken when a patient presents with ACS. ACS is a medical emergency requiring prompt action. Initial treatments for all ACS patients include:

- Oxygen if `SpO2 <94%`
- Analgesia (most commonly morphine)
- Nitrates (e.g., glyceryl trinitrate)
- Aspirin (300mg)

### Management by Type

#### In STEMI:

- If it has been `<12 hours` since symptom onset and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is available within `120 minutes`:
  - Administer anticoagulants and send the patient for PCI.
  
- If PCI is not available within `120 minutes`:
  - Provide anticoagulants and start thrombolysis with drugs like alteplase.
  
- If it has been `>12 hours` since symptom onset:
  - Offer ticagrelor with aspirin unless there is a high bleeding risk.
  - Consider clopidogrel with aspirin or aspirin alone for high bleeding risk.

#### In NSTEMI or UA:

Patients are risk-stratified using the GRACE score:

- If low risk, consider conservative management without angiography:
  - Offer ticagrelor with aspirin unless there is a high bleeding risk.
  - Consider clopidogrel with aspirin or aspirin alone for high bleeding risk.
  
- If high risk, give immediate angiography if clinically unstable:
  - Otherwise, consider angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) within `72 hours` if no contraindications.
  - If no indication for oral anticoagulation, offer ticagrelor with aspirin.
  - If a separate indication for oral anticoagulation exists, offer clopidogrel with aspirin.

### Long-term Management

In the longer term, consider prescribing:

- **Beta-blocker**: Often bisoprolol as it is cardioselective.
- **ACE-inhibitor**
- **Dual antiplatelet therapy**: For 1 year, then switch to aspirin 75mg indefinitely.
- **High-dose statin**: 80mg.

### Monitoring for Complications

Monitor for complications and manage them accordingly. These may include:

#### Under `2 weeks`:

- Arrhythmias
- Ventricular septal defect
- Mitral regurgitation (due to papillary muscle rupture)
- Ventricular wall rupture
- Pericarditis

#### Over `2 weeks`:

- Heart Failure
- Dressler’s syndrome (autoimmune pericarditis managed with NSAIDs)
- Ventricular aneurysm

### Risk Factor Management

In the long-term, it's important to manage risk factors through:

- Good diabetic control
- Smoking cessation
- Blood pressure management
- Statin therapy for hypercholesterolaemia
- Diet and exercise

  {
    question: "A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension and smoking presents to the emergency department with severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to his left arm. He is diaphoretic, and an ECG shows ST-segment elevation. Which of the following best represents the appropriate initial management for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Start aspirin and nitroglycerin, and prepare for thrombolytics",
      "Administer clopidogrel and schedule for immediate coronary angiography",
      "Perform a coronary angiogram and decide on intervention based on findings",
      "Initiate beta-blockers and observe for improvement",
      "Provide opioids and monitor in a non-emergency setting"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For a patient with ST-segment elevation on ECG who presents with symptoms consistent with a STEMI, initial management involves starting aspirin (preferably chewable) and nitroglycerin for pain relief. Additionally, the patient should be prepared for thrombolytic therapy or PCI, depending on the timing and availability. This approach is necessary to restore coronary blood flow as quickly as possible.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's symptoms and the critical nature of ST-segment elevation on the ECG. The immediate actions should focus on enhancing blood flow to the affected area while ensuring adequate pain control. What initial medications are recommended in this context?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 75-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease presents with atypical symptoms of ACS, namely fatigue and indigestion. ECG reveals T-wave inversions. Which type of acute coronary syndrome is most likely in this patient?",
    options: [
      "ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)",

    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of T-wave inversions alongside atypical symptoms points towards a Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). It is crucial to note that elderly patients and those with chronic conditions may present with atypical symptoms rather than classic presentations of ACS.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Atypical presentations, especially in the elderly, can lead to under-recognition of acute coronary syndromes. Reflect on the differences in ECG findings between the types of ACS. What does T-wave inversion indicate in this context?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following would be a priority in the acute management of a patient presenting with NSTEMI if they are classified as high risk according to the GRACE score?",
    options: [
      "Immediate thrombolytic therapy",
      "Early coronary angiography",
      "Increase beta-blocker dosage",
      "Start oral anticoagulation",
      "Discharge with outpatient follow-up"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! High-risk patients with NSTEMI should undergo early coronary angiography, ideally within 72 hours, as it allows for identification of coronary lesions that may require intervention. Early angiography can help in planning the further management of such patients effectively.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the risk assessment of the patient. In high-risk scenarios, certain interventions are prioritized to prevent further complications and improve outcomes. What clinical guidelines address the management of high-risk NSTEMI patients?"
