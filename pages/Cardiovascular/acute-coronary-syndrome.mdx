# Understanding Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) involves a spectrum of conditions characterized by acute ischemia or infarction of the myocardium. ACS can be classified into three main categories:

- **Unstable Angina (UA):** Evident myocardial damage (e.g., chest pain at rest) without changes in cardiac biomarkers.
- **Non ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI):** Myocardial damage with elevated cardiac biomarkers but no ST elevation on an Electrocardiogram (ECG), indicating a partial-thickness infarct.
- **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI):** Demonstrates myocardial damage with both elevated cardiac biomarkers and persistent ST elevation on ECG, representing a full-thickness infarct.

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors

ACS risk factors are divided into two categories:

- **Modifiable:**
  - Smoking
  - Type 2 diabetes
  - Hypertension
  - Hypercholesterolemia
  - Obesity
  - Sedentary lifestyle
  - Cocaine use

- **Non-modifiable:**
  - Increasing age
  - Male gender
  - Family history

### Symptoms

Common symptoms associated with ACS include:

- Central or left-sided "crushing" chest pain, potentially radiating to the jaw or left arm
- Shortness of breath
- Sweating
- Nausea and vomiting

*Note:* Atypical presentations, such as dyspepsia or absence of chest pain, may occur in females, diabetics, or the elderly.

**Warning:** There are few physical signs that can be elicited in ACS patients.

## Investigations

### Bedside

- **Basic Observations**
- **Serial ECGs:**
  - **STEMI:** ST elevation in specific leads depending on the infarct location
  - **NSTEMI or UA:** T-wave inversion or ST depression
  - Continuous ECG changes may indicate an evolving myocardial infarction

| Heart Territory | Coronary Artery | Leads Showing Ischemic Changes |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Lateral         | Left circumflex artery | I, aVL, V5, V6            |
| Anteroseptal    | Left anterior descending artery | V1–V4              |
| Inferior        | Posterior descending artery (from right coronary in 80% or left circumflex in 20%) | II, III, aVF |
| Posterior       | Posterior descending artery (from right coronary in 80% or left circumflex in 20%) | Reciprocal changes: prominent R waves, flat ST depression, and T-wave inversion in V1-V4 |

### Blood Tests

- **Cardiac Markers:**
  - Serial troponin measurements (elevated in NSTEMI and STEMI 4-6 hours post-injury, remaining elevated for up to 10 days)
  - Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and myoglobin can also be measured
- **Full Blood Count (FBC):** To check for anemia
- **Urea and Electrolytes (U&E):** Hyperkalemia may cause arrhythmias
- **Blood Glucose and Lipid Profile:** To assess risk factors

### Imaging

- **Coronary Angiogram:** Diagnostic investigation of choice
- **Erect Chest X-ray:** To rule out pneumothorax, a differential diagnosis
- **Echocardiogram (ECHO):** To assess heart function

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

In emergencies, an ABCDE approach is crucial when a patient presents with ACS. ACS is a medical emergency that requires prompt action. Initially, all ACS patients should be provided with:

- Oxygen if `SpO2 <94%`
- Analgesia, commonly morphine
- Nitrates, such as glyceryl trinitrate
- Aspirin 300mg

### Management

Management strategies depend on whether the diagnosis is STEMI, NSTEMI, or UA.

#### STEMI Management

- **If `<12 hours` since symptom onset and PCI is available within 120 minutes:**
  - Administer anticoagulants and perform PCI

- **If `<12 hours` since symptom onset and PCI is unavailable in 120 minutes:**
  - Administer anticoagulants and initiate thrombolysis with drugs like alteplase

- **If `>12 hours` since symptom onset:**
  - Medically manage the patient:
    - Offer ticagrelor with aspirin unless there's a high bleeding risk
    - Consider clopidogrel with aspirin, or aspirin alone, for high bleeding risk

For more information, refer to the [NICE STEMI guidelines](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng185/resources/visual-summary-stemi-pdf-8900623405).

#### NSTEMI or UA Management

Patients are risk stratified using the GRACE score:

- **Low Risk:**
  - Consider conservative management without angiography
  - Offer ticagrelor with aspirin unless there's a high bleeding risk
  - Consider clopidogrel with aspirin, or aspirin alone, for high bleeding risk

- **High Risk:**
  - Provide immediate angiography if clinically unstable
  - Otherwise, consider angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) within 72 hours if no contraindications
  - If no separate indication for oral anticoagulation, offer ticagrelor with aspirin
  - If a separate indication for oral anticoagulation exists, offer clopidogrel with aspirin

For more information, refer to the [NICE NSTEMI/UA guidelines](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng185/resources/visual-summary-unstable-angina-nstemi-pdf-8900622109).

### Long-term Management

Long-term prescriptions include:

- Beta-blocker, often bisoprolol due to its cardioselectivity
- ACE-inhibitor
- Dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 year, followed by aspirin indefinitely (switch to 75mg)
- High-dose (80mg) statin

Patients should be monitored for complications and treated accordingly. These complications include:

- **Within `<2 weeks`:**
  - Arrhythmias
  - Ventricular septal defect
  - Mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle rupture
  - Ventricular wall rupture
  - Pericarditis

- **After `>2 weeks`:**
  - Heart failure
  - Dressler’s syndrome (autoimmune pericarditis managed with NSAIDs)
  - Ventricular aneurysm

### Risk Factor Management

Long-term management also involves addressing risk factors, such as:

- Good diabetic control
- Smoking cessation
- Effective blood pressure control
- Statins for hypercholesterolemia
- Diet and exercise
