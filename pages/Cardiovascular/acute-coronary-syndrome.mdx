# Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses a spectrum of conditions caused by sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart, resulting in myocardial ischemia or infarction. The three main types are:

- **Unstable Angina (UA):** Characterized by myocardial damage symptoms like chest pain at rest, without changes in cardiac biomarkers.
- **Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI):** Evidenced by myocardial damage with elevated cardiac biomarkers but no ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG), indicating a partial-thickness heart muscle infarct.
- **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI):** Involves myocardial damage with both elevated cardiac biomarkers and persistent ST elevation on ECG, suggesting a full-thickness heart muscle infarct.

## Diagnosis

**Risk Factors**

Risk factors for ACS can be categorized into:

- **Modifiable:**
  - Smoking
  - Type 2 diabetes
  - Hypertension
  - Hypercholesterolemia
  - Obesity
  - Sedentary lifestyle
  - Cocaine use

- **Non-modifiable:**
  - Increasing age
  - Male gender
  - Family history

**Symptoms**

Symptoms indicative of ACS include:

- Central or left-sided "crushing" chest pain, potentially radiating to the jaw or left arm
- Shortness of breath
- Sweating
- Nausea and vomiting

*Note: Atypical presentations may occur, especially in women, diabetics, or older adults, such as dyspepsia or absence of chest pain.*

**Physical Signs**

There are minimal physical signs that can be elicited in ACS patients.

## Investigations

**Bedside Tests**

- Basic observations
- Serial ECGs:
  - **STEMI:** ST-elevation in leads depending on the infarction area
  - **NSTEMI or UA:** T-wave inversion or ST-depression
  - Continuous ECG changes may indicate evolving myocardial infarction

<details>
<summary>ECG Changes and Heart Territories</summary>

| Heart Territory | Coronary Artery | Leads Showing Ischemic Changes |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Lateral         | Left circumflex artery | I, aVL, V5, V6 |
| Anteroseptal    | Left anterior descending artery | V1 – V4 |
| Inferior        | Posterior descending artery (right coronary in 80% or left circumflex in 20%) | II, III, aVF |
| Posterior       | Posterior descending artery (right coronary in 80% or left circumflex in 20%) | Prominent R waves, flat ST depression, and T wave inversion in V1-V4 |

</details>

**Blood Tests**

- **Cardiac Markers:**
  - Serial troponin (elevated in NSTEMI and STEMI 4-6 hours post-injury, remains elevated for 10 days)
  - CK-MB and myoglobin
- **Full Blood Count (FBC):** Check for anemia
- **U&E:** Hyperkalemia may cause arrhythmias
- **Blood Glucose and Lipid Profile:** Evaluate risk factors

**Imaging**

- **Coronary Angiogram:** Preferred diagnostic tool
- **Erect Chest X-ray:** To exclude differential diagnoses like pneumothorax
- **ECHO:** Assess heart function

## Emergency Diagnosis and Management

In emergencies, follow the ABCDE approach. ACS requires immediate treatment. All ACS patients should initially receive:

- Oxygen if `SpO2 <94%`
- Analgesia, typically morphine
- Nitrates, such as glyceryl trinitrate
- Aspirin `300mg`

## Management

**STEMI Management**

- If `<12 hours` since symptom onset and PCI is available within `120 minutes`, administer anticoagulants and perform PCI.
- If `<12 hours` since symptom onset and PCI is unavailable within `120 minutes`, give anticoagulants and initiate thrombolysis with drugs like alteplase.
- If `>12 hours` since symptom onset, manage medically:
  - Offer ticagrelor with aspirin unless high bleeding risk.
  - Consider clopidogrel with aspirin, or aspirin alone, for high bleeding risk.

</Callout>

**NSTEMI or UA Management**

Use the GRACE score for risk stratification:

- **Low Risk:** Consider conservative management without angiography.
  - Offer ticagrelor with aspirin unless high bleeding risk.
  - Consider clopidogrel with aspirin, or aspirin alone, for high bleeding risk.

- **High Risk:** Immediate angiography if clinically unstable. Otherwise, consider angiography (and PCI if indicated) within `72 hours` if no contraindications.
  - Offer ticagrelor with aspirin unless there's a separate indication for oral anticoagulation.
  - If a separate indication exists, offer clopidogrel with aspirin.

</Callout>

**Long-Term Management**

- Beta blockers, often bisoprolol for its cardioselectivity
- ACE inhibitors
- Dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 year, followed by indefinite aspirin (switch to `75mg`)
- High-dose statin (`80mg`)

**Complications Monitoring**

- **`<2 weeks`:** Arrhythmias, ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation (due to papillary muscle rupture), ventricular wall rupture, pericarditis.
- **`>2 weeks`:** Heart failure, Dressler’s syndrome (autoimmune pericarditis managed with NSAIDs), ventricular aneurysm.

**Risk Factor Management**

- Effective diabetic control
- Smoking cessation
- Blood pressure management
- Statins for hypercholesterolemia
- Healthy diet and regular exercise
