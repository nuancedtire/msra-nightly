# Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Management

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a critical condition frequently encountered by junior doctors. Proper management is crucial and follows the ABCDE approach. This document outlines the essential steps for managing suspected Myocardial Infarction (MI).

## Initial Management Steps

- **Aspirin**: Administer `300mg` orally immediately, followed by `75mg` once daily.
- **Oxygen Therapy**: Only indicated if oxygen saturation is `SpO2 <90%`.
- **Pain Management**: Morphine `2-4mg` intravenously every 5-15 minutes until pain is controlled.
- **Nitrates**: Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) `0.3-1mg` sublingually up to three times; can also be administered intravenously if not hypotensive.
- **P2Y12 Inhibitors**: Use ticagrelor, prasugrel, or cangrelor as first-line options; clopidogrel is second-line.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Note:** The mnemonic ‘MONAC’ (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitrates, Aspirin, Clopidogrel) is a helpful memory aid. However, current guidelines do not recommend routine oxygen supplementation unless the patient is hypoxic. Additionally, clopidogrel is less effective compared to the first-line P2Y12 inhibitors.

## Revascularization

Revascularization is the gold standard for ACS management:

- **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)**: Preferred method. 
- **Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)**: Considered if PCI is unsuccessful.
- **Thrombolysis**: Used if PCI is unavailable within `90 minutes` and symptoms are within `12 hours` of onset. Agents include reteplase, alteplase, or tenecteplase.

- Active bleeding
- Ischaemic stroke within the last `3 months`
- Previous intracranial haemorrhage
</details>

## Additional Emergency Treatments

- **Anticoagulation**: Unfractionated heparin is preferred before PCI, alongside antiplatelet therapy.
- **Glucose Control**: Administer intravenous insulin if blood glucose is elevated.
- **Inotropic Support**: Dobutamine infusion may benefit patients in low cardiac output states or cardiogenic shock.
- **Beta-blockers**: Initiate as soon as possible to decrease infarction size; exercise caution in cases of heart failure, hypotension, bradycardia, or asthma.

## Long-term Management

- **Dual Antiplatelet Therapy**: Aspirin combined with ticagrelor or prasugrel for at least `12 months` (aspirin continued indefinitely).
- **ACE Inhibitor**: Prescribe for long-term management.
- **Beta-blockers**: Continued as part of the treatment plan.
- **Statins**: Essential for managing cholesterol levels.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with chest pain radiating to his left arm. His ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads. Initial management includes aspirin and morphine. Which of the following additional treatments should be administered immediately?",
    options: [
      "Oxygen therapy",
      "Intravenous heparin",
      "Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate",
      "Intravenous insulin"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) should be given immediately unless the patient is hypotensive, as it helps relieve chest pain by dilating coronary vessels.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the mnemonic 'MONAC' and recall which treatments are indicated immediately in ACS management."
  },
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes is admitted with a suspected myocardial infarction. Her oxygen saturation is 85%. According to current guidelines, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in her management?",
    options: [
      "Administer supplemental oxygen",
      "Initiate beta-blocker therapy",
      "Start intravenous dobutamine",
      "Prepare for thrombolysis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Supplemental oxygen should be administered as her oxygen saturation is below 90%.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the indications for oxygen therapy in ACS. What is the threshold for oxygen saturation?"
  },
  {

    options: [
      "1 month",
      "3 months",
      "6 months",
      "12 months"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 12 months following PCI in the context of an acute coronary syndrome.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the guidelines for dual antiplatelet therapy duration post-PCI in ACS patients."
