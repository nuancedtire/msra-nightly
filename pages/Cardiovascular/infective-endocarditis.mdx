# Infective Endocarditis: Diagnosis and Management

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardium of the heart, which includes:

- The heart valves (most common site)
- Chordae tendineae
- Septal defects
- Mural endocardium

The most common causative agents are:

- **Staphylococcus aureus**
- **Streptococci viridans**
- **Staphylococcus epidermidis**
- **Streptococcus bovis**

Also, be aware of some less common causative organisms, collectively known as **HACEK**:

- **H**aemophilus species
- **A**ctinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans
- **C**ardiobacterium hominis
- **E**ikenella corrodens
- **K**ingella species

This group of organisms cannot be grown using standard blood culture methods and are thus termed “culture-negative”.

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors

Common risk factors for IE include:

- Previous IE
- Prosthetic heart valves
- Intravenous drug users (IVDU)
- Indwelling lines
- Cardiac implanted devices
- Previous heart transplant

### Patient Presentation

Patients may present with the following signs and symptoms:

- **Fever/rigors**
- **New murmur**
- **Constitutional symptoms**:
  - Night sweats
  - Fatigue
  - Lack of appetite
  - Weight loss
  - Myalgia

- **Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure**:
  - Shortness of breath on exertion
  - Orthopnoea
  - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea
  - Peripheral oedema
  - Raised JVP
  - Bilateral basal lung crepitations

- **Signs of Septic Emboli**:
  - Brain (weakness, focal neurology, meningism)
  - Kidneys (haematuria)
  - Joints (arthralgia)

- **Rare Signs on Examination**:
  - Janeway lesions – painless plaques on palms and soles
  - Osler’s nodes – painful nodules on fingers and toes
  - Roth’s spots – white central retinal haemorrhages
  - Splinter haemorrhages in the nails

### Diagnostic Criteria

The **Duke criteria** combines risk factors, symptoms, signs, and investigations to diagnose IE. 

A diagnosis of IE is confirmed if:

- **2 major criteria** are met, or
- **1 major and 3 minor criteria** are met.

#### Major Criteria

- 2 separate positive blood cultures
- Endocardial involvement on echocardiogram, which may include:
  - Vegetation
  - Abscess
  - New dehiscence of prosthetic valve
  - New valvular regurgitation

#### Minor Criteria

- Predisposing heart condition or IVDU
- Fever over `38ºC`
- Vascular abnormalities such as:
  - Arterial emboli
  - Septic emboli
  - Pulmonary infarcts
  - Mycotic aneurysm
  - Intracranial haemorrhage
  - Conjunctival haemorrhage
  - Janeway lesions
- Immunological abnormalities such as:
  - Glomerulonephritis
  - Osler’s nodes
  - Roth spots
  - Presence of rheumatoid factor
- Microbiological evidence:
  - Positive blood cultures that do not meet major criteria 
- Echocardiography evidence:
  - Findings consistent with IE that do not meet major criteria

## Investigations

### Bedside Tests

- **ECG**:
  - Prolonged PR interval
  - Non-specific ST/T wave changes
  - Heart block

- **Urinalysis**:
  - Proteinuria
  - Haematuria
  - Pyuria
  - Red blood cell casts
  - White blood cell casts

### Blood Tests

- **Blood cultures**: Three sets from different venous sites `1 hour` apart and before administering antibiotics.
- **FBC**: Normocytic, normochromic anaemia, leukocytosis.
- **U&Es**; especially when suspecting septic emboli to kidneys.
- **Rheumatoid factor**.

### Imaging

- **Echocardiogram**: Identifies vegetations.
  - **Transthoracic Echo** is first-line, but **transesophageal** echocardiography may be considered if:
    - Transthoracic echo is negative
    - Presence of prosthetic valves
    - Complications are likely
    - Pre-cardiac surgery during active IE

- **Chest X-ray**: May show signs of heart failure.

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

An **A to E** approach should be adopted when managing a patient with infective endocarditis. 

### Initial Management

Focus on the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation. Perform the **sepsis 6** within `1 hour` of presentation.

- **Empirical Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics**:
  - Amoxicillin +/- gentamicin (native valves)
  - Vancomycin + gentamicin + rifampicin (prosthetic valves)

Administer antibiotics after blood cultures are taken.

## Management (Prescribing)

Once the causative organism is known, treatment for IE may include:

- **Staphylococci**:
  - Flucloxacillin (native valve) 
  - Flucloxacillin + rifampicin + gentamicin (prosthetic valve)
    - If MRSA, substitute flucloxacillin with vancomycin.
  
- **Streptococci**: Benzylpenicillin +/- gentamicin.
- **Enterococci**: Amoxicillin.
- **HACEK**: Ceftriaxone +/- gentamicin.

Final antibiotic choices are dictated by local guidelines and are administered IV for `4-6 weeks`.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Surgical intervention may involve removal of infected tissue and repair or replacement of affected valves. 

### Indications for Surgery

Surgery is indicated for:

- Decompensated heart failure
- Sepsis despite antibiotic therapy
- Perivalvular abscess
- Intracardiac fistulae
- Valve perforation or dehiscence
- Recurrent emboli despite antibiotic treatment
- Prosthetic valve endocarditis
- Fungal endocarditis
- Pregnancy
