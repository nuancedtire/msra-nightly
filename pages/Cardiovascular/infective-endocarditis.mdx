# Infective Endocarditis: Diagnosis and Management

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the heart's endocardium, primarily affecting the valves, chordae tendineae, septal defects, and mural endocardium. The most common pathogens responsible for IE include **Staphylococcus aureus**, **Streptococci viridans**, **Staphylococcus epidermidis**, and **Streptococcus bovis**. Additionally, it's crucial to recognize the HACEK group of organisms (**H**aemophilus species, **A**ctinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, **C**ardiobacterium hominis, **E**ikenella corrodens, and **K**ingella species), which are termed "culture-negative" as they do not grow in standard blood cultures.

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors

Individuals at higher risk for developing IE include those with:

- Previous infective endocarditis
- Prosthetic heart valves
- Intravenous drug use (IVDU)
- Indwelling vascular lines
- Cardiac implanted devices
- History of heart transplant

### Clinical Presentation

Common signs and symptoms observed in patients with IE:

- **Fever/Rigors**
- **New Heart Murmur**
- **Constitutional Symptoms**: night sweats, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, myalgia
- **Heart Failure Symptoms**:
  - Shortness of breath during exertion
  - Orthopnea
  - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
  - Peripheral edema
  - Raised jugular venous pressure (JVP)
  - Bilateral basal lung crepitations
- **Septic Emboli Symptoms**:
  - Brain: weakness, focal neurological deficits, meningism
  - Kidneys: hematuria
  - Joints: arthralgia
- **Rare Physical Findings**:
  - Janeway lesions: painless plaques on palms and soles
  - Osler's nodes: painful nodules on fingers and toes
  - Roth's spots: white-centered retinal hemorrhages
  - Splinter hemorrhages in nails

### Diagnostic Criteria

The Duke criteria integrate risk factors, clinical presentation, and investigative findings to diagnose IE. A definitive diagnosis requires either `2 major criteria` or `1 major and 3 minor criteria`.

#### Major Criteria

- **Positive Blood Cultures**: `2 separate positive blood cultures`
- **Endocardial Involvement on Echocardiogram**:
  - Vegetation
  - Abscess
  - New dehiscence of prosthetic valve
  - New valvular regurgitation

#### Minor Criteria

- Predisposing heart condition or IVDU
- Fever `>38ºC`
- Vascular phenomena:
  - Arterial emboli
  - Septic emboli
  - Pulmonary infarcts
  - Mycotic aneurysm
  - Intracranial hemorrhage
  - Conjunctival hemorrhage
  - Janeway lesions
- Immunologic phenomena:
  - Glomerulonephritis
  - Osler's nodes
  - Roth's spots
  - Presence of rheumatoid factor
- Microbiological evidence not meeting major criteria
- Echocardiography findings consistent with IE not meeting major criteria

## Investigations

### Bedside Tests

- **ECG**: may show prolonged PR interval, non-specific ST/T wave changes, heart block
- **Urinalysis**: proteinuria, hematuria, pyuria, red and white blood cell casts

### Blood Tests

- **Blood Cultures**: three sets from different venous sites one hour apart, before antibiotics
- **Full Blood Count (FBC)**: normocytic, normochromic anemia, leukocytosis
- **Urea and Electrolytes (U&Es)**: particularly if suspecting renal septic emboli
- **Rheumatoid Factor**

### Imaging

- **Echocardiogram**: identifies vegetations
  - Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is first-line
  - Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) considered if:
    - TTE is negative
    - Presence of prosthetic valves
    - Likely complications
    - Pre-cardiac surgery during active IE
- **Chest X-ray**: may reveal heart failure signs

## Emergency Management

An A to E assessment is critical for patients with suspected IE. Immediate management should address airway, breathing, and circulation. Perform the sepsis 6 protocol within the first hour of presentation.

**Warning:** Initiate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics after obtaining blood cultures.
</Callout>

- **Native Valve:** Amoxicillin +/- gentamicin
- **Prosthetic Valve:** Vancomycin + gentamicin + rifampicin

## Treatment

### Antibiotic Therapy

Once the causative organism is identified, tailor antibiotic therapy as follows:

- **Staphylococci**:
  - Native valve: Flucloxacillin
  - Prosthetic valve: Flucloxacillin + rifampicin + gentamicin
  - If MRSA: Substitute flucloxacillin with vancomycin
- **Streptococci**: Benzylpenicillin +/- gentamicin
- **Enterococci**: Amoxicillin
- **HACEK**: Ceftriaxone +/- gentamicin

Antibiotics are administered intravenously for `4-6 weeks` according to local guidelines.

### Surgical Intervention

Surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue or repair affected valves. Indications include:

- Decompensated heart failure
- Persistent sepsis despite antibiotics
- Perivalvular abscess
- Intracardiac fistulae
- Valve perforation or dehiscence
- Recurrent emboli despite antibiotics
- Prosthetic valve endocarditis
- Fungal endocarditis
- Pregnancy

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old male with a history of intravenous drug use presents with fever, malaise, and a new-onset heart murmur. Blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial empirical antibiotic therapy?",

    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's history of intravenous drug use and common pathogens causing endocarditis in such cases. What combination would cover likely resistant organisms?"
