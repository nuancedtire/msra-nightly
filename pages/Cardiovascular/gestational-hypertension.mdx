# Gestational Hypertension (GHTN)

Gestational hypertension (GHTN) is a **hypertensive disorder** characterized by the onset of elevated blood pressure at `≥20 weeks` of gestation, with resolution postpartum. It clinically manifests in:

- **6-17%** of otherwise healthy women with no previous births.
- **2-4%** of women who have had multiple pregnancies.

## Risk Factors

GHTN can arise due to various risk factors, which include:

* **Obesity**: BMI `>30` or pregnancy BMI `>25`
* **Age**: `<20 years` and `>40 years`
* **Past Medical History**:
  - Diabetes
  - Chronic and gestational hypertension
  - Chronic renal disease
* **Autoimmune Conditions**: SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome
* **Family History**: Pre-eclampsia
* **Pregnancy History**:
  - First pregnancy
  - Multifetal pregnancy
  - Complications related to placenta insufficiency (e.g., stillbirth, fetal growth restriction)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of GHTN is confirmed under the following conditions:

- **Blood Pressure Criteria**:
  - Systolic BP `≥140 mmHg` and/or diastolic BP `≥90 mmHg`
- **Additional Requirements**:
  - No documented chronic hypertension prior to pregnancy
  - At least two BP measurements, done at least `4-6 hours` apart
  - First onset of hypertension `≥20 weeks` of pregnancy
  - Absence of proteinuria (`<300mg` of protein in 24-hour urine)
  - Absence of new-onset end-organ failure

### Severe Hypertension

GHTN is classified as severe if:

- Systolic BP `≥160 mmHg` and/or diastolic BP `≥110 mmHg`.

If elevated BP persists for `≥12 weeks` post-labour, the diagnosis changes to chronic hypertension.

## Investigations

The following investigations are essential for confirming GHTN:

* **Medical History**: Review known risk factors, initial blood pressure readings pre-pregnancy.
* **Blood Pressure Readings**: Conduct at least twice, `4-6 hours` apart. Home monitoring is advised to rule out white coat hypertension.
* **Urinary Protein Excretion**: Determine presence or absence of proteinuria, preferably through:
  - 24-hour urine collection (higher accuracy)
  - Random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio
* **Physical Examination**: Check for end-organ dysfunction indicators like:
  - CNS symptoms (blurred vision, light sensitivity)
  - Nausea, vomiting
  - Persistent headaches
  - Signs of liver dysfunction or pulmonary edema
* **Laboratory Tests**:
  - Liver function tests (LFTs)
  - Full blood count (FBC)
  - Serum creatinine levels
* **Fetal Status Assessment**: Biophysical profile or non-stress test with estimation of amniotic fluid.

## Management

### Prescribing Management

Antihypertensive therapy is recommended if blood pressure remains above `140/90 mmHg` on multiple occasions. For severe cases (`>160/110 mmHg`), treatment should be initiated. First-line options include:

- **Labetalol**
- **Nifedipine**: Consider if labetalol is unsuitable.
- **Methyldopa**: Consider if neither labetalol nor nifedipine are suitable.

### Non-Prescribing Management

Patient education and counseling are crucial in managing GHTN. Key components include:

- **Symptoms Alert**: Inform patients about symptoms indicating progression to pre-eclampsia.
- **Fetal Monitoring**: Teach how to assess fetal well-being.
- **Activity Recommendations**: Short periods of bed rest may be considered, but prolonged bed rest is discouraged.
- **Delivery Timing**: 
  - **Uncomplicated pregnancies** with mild GHTN should deliver at term (`38+0` to `39+6` weeks).
  - **Severe GHTN** with comorbidities should aim for delivery at `37+0` weeks.

**Warning:** All patients with severe hypertension should be monitored closely for potential complications.

    question: "A 28-year-old woman, currently 25 weeks pregnant, presents with elevated blood pressure readings (systolic BP 145 mmHg, diastolic BP 92 mmHg) during her routine check-up. She has no history of hypertension prior to pregnancy and reports no symptoms of proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Initiate antihypertensive therapy and schedule delivery at 37 weeks",
      "Repeat blood pressure measurements in 4-6 hours",
      "Schedule a 24-hour urine collection for proteinuria",
      "Monitor blood pressure at home for the next week",
      "Advise lifestyle modifications and follow-up in 2 weeks"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient meets the criteria for the diagnosis of gestational hypertension. Since her blood pressure exceeds the threshold for treatment, starting an antihypertensive therapy is appropriate, particularly considering she is beyond 20 weeks of gestation. Delivering at 37 weeks is recommended for management of severe cases to minimize risks to both mother and fetus.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the guidelines for managing pregnancy-related hypertension. Given her elevated blood pressure without prior history and considering the gestational timing, what actions align with established protocols for treatment?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old multiparous woman presents at 30 weeks of gestation with blood pressure readings of 160/110 mmHg. She reports headache and visual disturbances. Urinalysis does not reveal proteinuria. What complication is this patient at highest risk for?",
    options: [
      "Gestational diabetes",
      "Gestational trophoblastic disease",
      "Pre-eclampsia",
      "Placental abruption",
      "Placenta previa"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient presents with severe gestational hypertension, and the presence of CNS symptoms heightens the concern for pre-eclampsia. Although she currently does not show proteinuria, the escalating blood pressure and symptoms indicate she is at significant risk for developing this condition.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the broader implications of severe hypertension during pregnancy. What symptoms and signs suggest a transition from simply gestational hypertension to a more severe complication that warrants immediate attention?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 22-year-old primigravid woman reports to the clinic with a blood pressure of 138/88 mmHg at 22 weeks of gestation. She has no significant past medical history. Her initial readings at 20 weeks were normal. What is the most appropriate diagnosis for her current condition?",
    options: [
      "Chronic hypertension",
      "Gestational hypertension",
      "Transient hypertension",
      "Preeclampsia",
      "Normal pregnancy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This case illustrates a woman with blood pressure readings that have crossed the threshold for diagnosis (≥140/90 mmHg) after the 20-week mark with no documented hypertension prior to pregnancy. This qualifies as gestational hypertension, given its timing relative to gestation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the criteria used to diagnose hypertension in pregnancy. What characteristics distinguish chronic hypertension from gestational hypertension, particularly regarding the timeline of blood pressure readings and prior medical history?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a history of gestational hypertension is concerned about her risk of developing hypertension after delivery. Which of the following statements is true regarding her potential outcomes?",
    options: [
      "Women with gestational hypertension are less likely to develop chronic hypertension compared to women without hypertension during pregnancy.",
      "The risk of developing chronic hypertension increases following gestational hypertension, especially if it persisted postpartum.",
      "Gestational hypertension resolves in all women before they leave the hospital.",
      "Chronic hypertension is generally resolved within one year after delivery.",
      "Gestational hypertension does not affect future pregnancy outcomes."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Women who experience gestational hypertension are at increased risk of developing chronic hypertension, particularly if hypertension persists for 12 weeks postpartum. Awareness and monitoring are crucial for these patients as they transition into the postpartum period.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the long-term implications that pregnancy-related hypertension has on future health. What are the expected trends and outcomes for women who experience hypertension during pregnancy, particularly concerning their cardiovascular health?"
