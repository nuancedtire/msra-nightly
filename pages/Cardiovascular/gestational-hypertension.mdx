# Understanding Gestational Hypertension

Gestational hypertension (GHTN) is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure that first appears at `≥20 weeks` of gestation and resolves postpartum. This condition affects `6-17%` of healthy women who have not previously given birth and `2-4%` of women who have. Below are the risk factors associated with GHTN:

- **Obesity:** BMI `>30` or pregnancy BMI `>25`
- **Age:** `<20 years` and `>40 years`
- **Medical History:** Past occurrences of diabetes, chronic and gestational hypertension, or chronic renal disease
- **Autoimmune Conditions:** Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome
- **Family Background:** History of pre-eclampsia
- **Pregnancy Details:** First pregnancy, multifetal pregnancy
- **Previous Pregnancy Complications:** Issues like stillbirth or fetal growth restriction linked to placental insufficiency

## Diagnosis

To diagnose gestational hypertension, the following criteria must be met with a systolic blood pressure `≥140 mmHg` and/or diastolic `≥90 mmHg`:

- No documented chronic hypertension prior to pregnancy
- At least two blood pressure readings, conducted `4-6 hours` apart
- First occurrence of hypertension at `≥20 weeks` of pregnancy
- Absence of proteinuria (`<300mg` of protein in a `24-hour` urine sample)
- No new signs of end-organ failure

**Severe GHTN** is classified by a systolic blood pressure `≥160 mmHg` and/or diastolic `≥110 mmHg`. If elevated blood pressure persists `≥12 weeks postpartum`, the diagnosis should be revised to chronic hypertension.

## Investigations

- **Medical History:** Assess risk factors and pre-pregnancy blood pressure
- **Blood Pressure Monitoring:** Multiple readings taken `4-6 hours` apart, with home monitoring to rule out white coat hypertension
- **Urinary Protein Excretion:** Use a `24-hour` urine collection or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio for accurate diagnosis
- **Physical Examination:** Check for signs of end-organ dysfunction, such as central nervous system symptoms (blurred vision, light sensitivity), nausea, vomiting, persistent headaches, hepatic issues, or pulmonary edema
- **Laboratory Tests:** Liver function tests (LFTs), full blood count (FBC), serum creatinine to exclude liver, platelet, and renal dysfunction
- **Fetal Assessment:** Biophysical profile or non-stress test with amniotic fluid estimation

## Management

### Prescribing

Antihypertensive therapy is advised for those with persistent blood pressure `>140/90 mmHg`. For severe cases (`>160/110 mmHg`), treatment is essential, starting with labetalol. If labetalol is unsuitable, consider nifedipine. Methyldopa should be considered if both labetalol and nifedipine are inappropriate.

### Non-Prescribing

Education and counselling are crucial in managing GHTN. Patients should learn to recognize symptoms that indicate progression to pre-eclampsia and how to monitor fetal well-being. Short periods of bed rest may be considered, but prolonged rest is discouraged. Delivery timing should be individualized. Women with mild GHTN and uncomplicated pregnancies should deliver at term (`38+0` to `39+6` weeks), while those with severe GHTN and comorbidities should deliver at `37+0` weeks.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation presents for a routine check-up. Her blood pressure readings taken 4 hours apart are 150/92 mmHg and 148/90 mmHg. She denies headaches, visual changes, or abdominal pain. Urine analysis shows no proteinuria. What is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?",
    options: [
      "Initiate antihypertensive therapy with labetalol",
      "Reassure and schedule for follow-up in 2 weeks",
      "Admit to the hospital for further evaluation",
      "Repeat blood pressure measurements in 1 week",
      "Start magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient has gestational hypertension, and antihypertensive therapy is indicated for persistent blood pressure >140/90 mmHg. Labetalol is a first-line treatment for managing hypertension in pregnancy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the guidelines for managing gestational hypertension and the threshold for initiating treatment. What steps are recommended for blood pressure readings above 140/90 mmHg in pregnancy?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 34-year-old woman with a history of gestational hypertension in a previous pregnancy is currently 22 weeks pregnant. Which of the following is a risk factor for the recurrence of gestational hypertension in this pregnancy?",
    options: [
      "Maternal age <20 years",
      "Chronic renal disease",
      "Multifetal pregnancy",
      "Pre-pregnancy BMI of 22",
      "Previous uncomplicated pregnancy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Multifetal pregnancy is a known risk factor for gestational hypertension. Other risk factors include obesity, history of hypertension, and autoimmune conditions.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about risk factors that are commonly associated with increased demands on the maternal cardiovascular system during pregnancy."
  },
  {
    question: "A 36-year-old woman with gestational hypertension is at 38 weeks of gestation. Her blood pressure is well controlled on nifedipine, and there are no signs of pre-eclampsia or fetal distress. What is the recommended management plan for delivery?",
    options: [
      "Immediate induction of labor",
      "Delivery at 40 weeks gestation",
      "Continue pregnancy and reassess at 42 weeks",
      "Delivery at term (between 38+0 to 39+6 weeks)",
      "Elective cesarean section at 39 weeks"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For women with mild gestational hypertension and uncomplicated pregnancies, delivery is recommended at term, which is between 38+0 to 39+6 weeks.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the guidelines for delivery timing in cases of gestational hypertension without severe features or complications."
  },
  {
    question: "A 25-year-old woman at 35 weeks of gestation presents with new-onset hypertension (148/96 mmHg) and proteinuria (450 mg/24-hour urine collection). She reports persistent headaches and visual disturbances. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
