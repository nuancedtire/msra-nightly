# Infective Endocarditis

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardium of the heart, which includes the valvesâ€”most commonly affected, the chordae tendineae, septal defects, and mural endocardium. The significance of IE within the context of the MRSA exam lies in its complex diagnosis, management, and potential for rapid deterioration.

Understanding IE's etiological agents, manifestations, and treatment options is critical for all medical professionals, as timely intervention can significantly alter patient outcomes.

## Causative Agents

The most common pathogens responsible for IE include:

- **Staphylococcus aureus**
- **Streptococci viridans**
- **Staphylococcus epidermidis**
- **Streptococcus bovis**

<Callout emoji="ðŸ§«">
**Note:** The HACEK group of bacteria (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella species) represent less common causative organisms that are typically "culture-negative."

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors

Risk factors for IE include:

- Previous IE
- Prosthetic heart valves
- **Intravenous drug users (IVDU)**
- Indwelling lines
- Cardiac implanted devices
- Previous heart transplant

### Clinical Presentation

Patients often present with:

- Fever/rigors
- *New murmur*
- Constitutional symptoms such as night sweats, fatigue, appetite loss, weight loss, and myalgia
- Signs and symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath on exertion, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, peripheral oedema, raised JVP, and bilateral basal lung crepitations
- Septic emboli, potentially affecting different organ systems (e.g., brain, kidneys, joints)

### Examination Findings

Rare signs on examination may include:

- Janeway lesions
- Oslerâ€™s nodes
- Rothâ€™s spots
- Splinter haemorrhages in the nails

### Duke Criteria

The Duke criteria aid in the diagnosis of IE, requiring two major, or one major and three minor criteria:

**Major Criteria:**

- Positive blood cultures (2 separate cultures)
- Evidence of endocardial involvement on an echocardiogram

**Minor Criteria:**

- Predisposing heart condition or IVDU
- Fever over `38ÂºC`
- Vascular abnormalities (e.g., arterial emboli, septic emboli)
- Immunological abnormalities (e.g., glomerulonephritis, Roth spots)

<summary>Extended List of Duke Criteria</summary>

**Vascular Abnormalities Include:**

- Arterial emboli
- Septic emboli
- Pulmonary infarcts
- Mycotic aneurysm
- Intracranial haemorrhage
- Conjunctival haemorrhage
- Janeway lesions

**Immunological Abnormalities Include:**

- Glomerulonephritis
- Oslerâ€™s nodes
- Roth spots
- Presence of rheumatoid factor

**Microbiological Evidence:**

- Positive blood cultures that do not meet the major criteria
- Findings on echocardiography consistent with IE that do not meet the major criteria

</details>

## Investigations

### Bedside Tests

- ECG: Prolonged PR interval, non-specific ST/T wave changes, heart block
- Urinalysis: Proteinuria, haematuria, pyuria, RBC and WBC casts

### Blood Tests

- Blood cultures: Three sets, from different venous sites, 1 hour apart and before antibiotics
- FBC: Normocytic, normochromic anaemia, leukocytosis
- U&Es: Especially if renal septic emboli are suspected
- Rheumatoid factor

### Imaging

- Echocardiogram: First-line transthoracic, or transesophageal if indicated
- Chest x-ray: May show signs of heart failure

## Management of Emergencies

An A to E approach is essential. Initial management includes attention to:

- Airway
- Breathing
- Circulation

Sepsis 6 should be performed within `<1 hour` of presentation.

### Empirical Antibiotic Therapy

Administer after obtaining blood cultures:

- Native valves: Amoxicillin +/âˆ’ gentamicin
- Prosthetic valves: Vancomycin + gentamicin + rifampicin

### Targeted Antibiotic Therapy

Once the causative organism is identified, treatment with the following IV antibiotics for 4-6 weeks is recommended:

- Staphylococci: Flucloxacillin (native valve) or flucloxacillin + rifampicin + gentamicin (prosthetic valve)
- MRSA: Vancomycin
- Streptococci: Benzylpenicillin +/âˆ’ gentamicin
- Enterococci: Amoxicillin
- HACEK: Ceftriaxone +/âˆ’ gentamicin

_Compliance with local guidelines is essential when selecting antibiotics._

### Surgical Management

Surgical interventions may be necessary to remove infected tissue and repair or replace affected valves. Indications include:

- Decompensated heart failure
- Persistent sepsis despite antibiotic therapy
- Perivalvular abscess, intracardiac fistulae
- Valve perforation or dehiscence
- Recurrent emboli despite antibiotics
- Prosthetic valve endocarditis
- Fungal endocarditis
- Pregnancy

  {
    question: "A 32-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use presents with fever, night sweats, and a new heart murmur. Blood cultures are drawn and an echocardiogram shows vegetations on the tricuspid valve. Which organisms should be primarily suspected in this patient's infective endocarditis?",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Intravenous drug users (IVDU) are particularly at risk for infective endocarditis with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common causative organism, followed by Streptococcus viridans.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that IVDUs are more susceptible to certain pathogens due to their risk factors. The most common causative agents in infective endocarditis include Staphylococcus aureus, which is particularly prevalent among IVDUs."
