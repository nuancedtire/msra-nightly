# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)

Diabetes is a **common disease** that is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. An estimated **10%** of the NHS yearly budget is spent on the treatment of diabetes, with predictions estimating about **5 million** people will be living with diabetes by 2025. Men account for a slightly higher proportion, making up **56%** of UK adults with diabetes, while women represent **44%**.

The two main types of diabetes mellitus are:
- **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)**: Approximately **10%** of all diabetes cases.
- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)**: About **90%** of all diabetes cases. 

### **Understanding Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**

T2DM is characterized by the body not producing sufficient insulin or the insulin not working effectively (termed as **insulin resistance**). This leads to **high levels of sugar** in the blood (hyperglycaemia) and can cause numerous **complications**, some of which can be life-threatening. T2DM is a **lifelong condition** that needs to be actively monitored to prevent deterioration.

### **Diagnosis**

T2DM often presents with non-specific symptoms compared to T1DM. Common symptoms include:

- **Polyuria** â€“ frequent urination
- **Polydipsia** â€“ excessive thirst
- **Polyphagia** â€“ increased appetite
- **Fatigue**
- **Recurrent infections** (urinary or genitourinary)
- **Asymptomatic** or late-stage complications (e.g., skin infections, foot ulcers, neuropathic pain, diabetic retinopathy, MI/stroke)

T2DM is associated with **metabolic syndrome**, which may include:
- **Central obesity** (`BMI > 30`)
- At least **two** of the following:
  - High triglyceride levels
  - High blood pressure
  - Low HDL levels
  - High glucose levels

### **Risk Factors**
**Main risk factor:** Obesity or being overweight.

Other risk factors include:
- **Ethnicity:**
  - South Asian â€“ **6 times** increased risk
  - Afro-Caribbean â€“ **2 times** increased risk
- **Family history**

### **Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetes Mellitus**

1. Symptoms of hyperglycaemia AND raised venous glucose levels on a single occasion:
   - `Fasting plasma glucose â‰¥ 7 mmol/L` OR `random plasma glucose â‰¥ 11.1 mmol/L`
  
2. Raised venous glucose on **two separate occasions**:
   - `Fasting plasma glucose â‰¥ 7 mmol/L`
   - `Random plasma glucose â‰¥ 11.1 mmol/L` OR
   - `Oral glucose tolerance test (75g sugar given, blood levels measured 2 hours later) â‰¥ 11.1 mmol/L`
  
3. `HbA1c levels â‰¥ 48 mmol/L (6.5%)`

### **Investigations**

Following history and clinical examination, further investigations include blood tests for glucose levels. Available blood tests are:

| Test Type                   | Description                              |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Fasting Plasma Glucose**  | Minimum 8-hour fast                      |
| **Random Plasma Glucose**   | Non-fasting blood test                   |
| **Oral Glucose Tolerance**  | 2-hour post-load glucose after 75g      |
| **HbA1c**                   | Reflects 3 monthsâ€™ glycaemic control     |

### **Management of T2DM Emergencies**

**Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemia State/Syndrome (HHS)** is a medical emergency associated with T2DM, characterized by:

- **High blood sugar levels**: Often `>30 mmol/L`
- **High osmolality**: Commonly `>340` (normal range: `275-295`)
  
**Treatment**:
- Rehydration with `0.9% normal saline` (adjust speed based on background)
- Monitor potassium levels and replace as needed
- Avoid insulin bolus to prevent rapid glucose shifts; titrate from low doses if needed

### **Management (Prescribing)**

The first-line treatment after conservative measures is typically **Metformin**. Additional oral hypoglycaemic agents may be used if control is not achieved.

A recent addition from NICE guidance is the use of **SGLT2 inhibitors** alongside metformin for patients at high cardiovascular risk.

#### **Oral Hypoglycaemic Agents Summary**

1. **Biguanides (Metformin)**
   - **Mechanism**: Increases glucose uptake, decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis
   - **Side Effects**: Gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhoea), **NOT** hypoglycaemia
   - **Contraindications**: `eGFR < 35 ml/min`

2. **Sulfonylureas (Gliclazide)**
   - **Mechanism**: Increases pancreatic insulin secretion
   - **Side Effects**: Weight gain, hypoglycaemia

3. **Thiazolidinediones / Glitazones (Pioglitazone)**
   - **Mechanism**: PPARÎ³ agonist; stimulates glucose transporter molecules
   - **Side Effects**: Weight gain, oedema, post-menopausal fractures, hepatotoxicity
   - **Contraindications**: Heart failure

4. **Gliptins (Sitagliptin)**
   - **Mechanism**: DPP4 inhibitors; increase GLP-1
   - **Side Effects**: Pancreatitis

5. **SGLT2 Inhibitors ('flozins')**
   - **Mechanism**: Inhibits glucose resorption in kidney
   - **Side Effects**: Increased UTI risk, diabetic ketoacidosis

6. **GLP-1 Analogues (Exenatide)**
   - **Mechanism**: Stimulate insulin release; decreases appetite
   - **Side Effects**: Gastrointestinal, injection site reactions

7. **Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors**
   - **Mechanism**: Reduces glucose absorption
   - **Side Effects**: Bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea

8. **Insulin**
   - Required when diet and oral hypoglycaemic agents are ineffective

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

**Non-pharmacological treatments** are crucial in managing T2DM. Patients should be educated about:
- Risk factors and prevention strategies
- Diet management: *Avoid high-sugar foods and consider low-carbohydrate diets*
- Exercise: *Aim for 30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 times a week*

Regular check-ups are essential, including:
- Eye tests
- Foot checks
- HbA1c, cholesterol, blood pressure measurements

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 55-year-old man with a BMI of 32 kg/mÂ² presents with increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. His fasting plasma glucose level is tested at 8.5 mmol/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Start insulin therapy immediately.",
      "Initiate lifestyle modification and prescribe Metformin.",
      "Refer the patient for bariatric surgery.",
      "Initiate treatment with a GLP-1 analogue.",
      "Perform an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given this patient's symptoms and fasting plasma glucose level, initiating lifestyle modifications along with Metformin is the first-line treatment for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin therapy is not typically the first step in the management of T2DM unless there is severe hyperglycaemia or other specific indications. Monitoring and adjusting lifestyle factors is also essential for long-term control.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the current guidelines on managing type 2 diabetes. Since this patient's glucose level indicates diabetes and he has an elevated BMI that fits with obesity as a risk factor, what would be the standard management steps recommended before considering more intensive treatments such as insulin or GLP-1 analogues?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 48-year-old woman diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus two years ago presents with recurrent urinary infections. She has a HbA1c of 9% despite being on Metformin. Which of the following medications should be added to her regimen to address both her glycaemic control and her urinary issues?",
    options: [
      "SGLT2 inhibitor",
      "Sulfonylurea",
      "Thiazolidinedione",
      "DPP-4 inhibitor",
      "GLP-1 analogue"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! SGLT2 inhibitors are beneficial for patients with diabetes who have recurrent urinary infections due to their mechanism of action that promotes glucose excretion in the urine. They can also provide additional cardiovascular and renal benefits.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's existing issues with recurrent urinary infections alongside her need for improved glycaemic control. Which class of medication works by preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys and therefore allows for glucose excretion in the urine? This might enhance her current treatment plan effectively."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a family history of diabetes presents with a fasting plasma glucose of 6.8 mmol/L and a random plasma glucose of 10.2 mmol/L. He has a BMI of 28 and reports no significant symptoms. What is the most appropriate initial management strategy for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Start immediate Metformin therapy.",
      "Implement lifestyle changes for 1-2 months before medication.",
      "Schedule a follow-up for further testing in a month.",
      "Begin glycemic monitoring only.",
      "Refer to an endocrinologist."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Current guidelines recommend implementing lifestyle changes for a period of 1-2 months before considering pharmacological interventions in patients with pre-diabetes or early diabetes. This approach can often yield better long-term results.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the importance of lifestyle modifications in the early stages of diabetes management. Given the patient's current glucose levels and lack of symptoms, would it make sense to first try non-pharmacological approaches before advancing to medication? How long should these lifestyle changes be monitored?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 60-year-old woman presenting in hyperglycaemic crisis had a blood glucose level of 35 mmol/L and an osmolality of 360 mOsm/kg. She has a history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. What is the most critical initial step in her management?",
    options: [
      "Start an intravenous insulin bolus.",
      "Administer intravenous fluids.",
      "Monitor blood pressure and heart rate.",
      "Administer oral glucose.",
      "Initiate DPP-4 inhibitor therapy."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The first step in managing hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state is rehydration. Administering normal saline helps to correct hyperosmolarity and dehydration before insulin is titrated, as rapid changes in glucose levels can precipitate complications.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the critical nature of rehydration in the treatment of hyperglycaemic crises. In what cases would intravenous fluids take precedence over insulin, especially when considering safety and gradual correction? How does the elevated osmolality factor into urgent care?"
