# Thyrotoxicosis

Thyrotoxicosis is the clinical syndrome caused by excessive thyroid hormones in the circulation, typically due to **hyperthyroidism**. Hyperthyroidism generally affects young adults, presenting predominantly between the ages of 20 and 40, and is approximately 10 times more common in women than men.

## Diagnosis

The signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis are often recognizable upon presentation.

### Symptoms

- Increased appetite and weight loss
- Sweating
- Palpitations
- Tremors 
- Irritability 
- Heat intolerance 
- Diarrhoea 
- Oligomenorrhoea 

### Signs

- **Tachycardia** / Atrial Fibrillation 
- Fine tremor 
- Palmar erythema 
- Lid lag / lid retraction 
- Goitre 
- If due to **Graves’ Disease**:
  - Eye signs: Exophthalmos, Ophthalmoplegia 
  - Pretibial myxoedema 
  - Thyroid acropachy: clubbing in nails 

## Causes

There are numerous causes of thyrotoxicosis, including:

- **Graves’ Disease**
  - An autoimmune condition leading to attack on the thyroid gland 
  - Approximately 75% of patients with hyperthyroidism have Graves’ disease 
- **Toxic multinodular goitre** / toxic adenoma
  - Extra thyroid tissue produces more thyroid hormone, causing elevated levels
- **Exogenous causes**
  - Iodine excess / levothyroxine excess 
- **Other causes**
  - Medications: Amiodarone (contains iodine) 
  - Cancer 
  - Subacute De Quervain’s thyroiditis 
  - Pituitary adenoma 
  - High levels of hCG (postpartum, multiple pregnancies, molar pregnancy)

## Investigations

If thyrotoxicosis is suspected, thyroid function tests should be performed, including TSH, T4, and T3 levels. Key results include:

- **Primary hyperthyroidism**: Low TSH levels with high T4 and T3 levels 
- **Secondary hyperthyroidism**: High TSH and high T4 levels 

It is also advisable to check for thyroid autoantibodies for Graves’ disease. If the cause is ambiguous, an isotope scan may be performed to look for thyroid nodules or thyroiditis. Additional blood tests, such as ESR, may be useful in diagnosing thyroiditis.

If Graves’ disease is suspected, a complete eye examination should be conducted, assessing visual fields, acuity, eye movements, and ophthalmoscopy.

Patients should be referred to a specialist endocrinologist for further management.

## Management (Prescribing)

Beta-blockers (e.g., `propranolol` 40mg every 6 hours) are frequently administered to manage symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. Once the cause is verified, treatment options include thionamides, such as:

- **Carbimazole**
- **Propylthiouracil**

There are two effective methods for administering these medications:

1. **Titration method**: Adjust doses according to thyroid function test results.
2. **Block and replace method**: Combine thionamides with thyroxine to minimize the risk of developing iatrogenic hypothyroidism. 

If a patient has Graves’ disease, they can remain on medication for approximately `12-18 months` before considering withdrawal. However, about 50% of patients may experience a relapse, necessitating further treatment via radiotherapy or surgery, based on individual needs.

### Thionamides

- **Mechanism**: Inhibit thyroid peroxidase, reducing thyroid hormone synthesis.
- **Side effects**:
  - Agranulocytosis: Decrease in white blood cell count 
    - **Contact a doctor** immediately if symptoms like sore throat, persistent cough, or high temperature occur as this may indicate an emergency.
  - Gastrointestinal upset, nausea, altered taste 
  - Headaches
  - Aching joints 
  - Itchy rash 

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

In addition to medication, **radiotherapy** or **surgery** are viable treatment options.

### Radioactive Iodine Treatment (RAI)

- Patients receive radioactive iodine (`I-131` isotope) that is specifically taken up by the thyroid gland.
- This treatment destroys thyroid cells, lowering overproduction of hormones.
  
#### Considerations for RAI:

- Some patients may experience complete symptom relief after one dose; others could require multiple doses or additional treatment.
- **Precautions**: 
  - Avoid close contact with children or pregnant women.
  - Female patients should avoid pregnancy for `6 months`.
  - Male patients should avoid fathering a child for `4 months`.

### Surgery

Surgery may be performed for various reasons:

- Large goitre
- Severe eye problems
- Inability to have other treatment options
- Recurrent symptoms despite multiple treatments

Removing the thyroid gland alleviates all thyrotoxicosis symptoms; however, patients will require lifelong medication, as they will no longer have a functioning thyroid gland.

  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman presents with increased appetite, weight loss, and palpitations. On examination, she has a fine tremor and a goitre. Thyroid function tests reveal low TSH and elevated T4 levels. Which condition is most likely causing her symptoms?",
    options: [
      "Subacute De Quervain’s thyroiditis",
      "Toxic multinodular goitre",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient’s symptoms and the low TSH with high T4 levels are characteristic of hyperthyroidism, most commonly caused by Graves’ disease, especially in a younger woman. The presence of a goitre and typical symptoms supports this diagnosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the most common causes of hyperthyroidism in young adults, particularly features that point towards autoimmune etiology, such as the goitre and specific symptoms of thyrotoxicosis."
  },
  {
