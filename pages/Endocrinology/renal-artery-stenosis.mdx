# Renal Artery Stenosis (RAS) Overview

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is defined as the narrowing of the renal artery lumen. A 50% reduction in vessel diameter is required in order to be considered radiographically significant. Complications arise from renal artery stenosis, such as **ischaemic nephropathy** and **renal vascular hypertension** due to the chronic reduction in **glomerular filtration rate**.

## Diagnosis

A number of key diagnostic factors are commonly associated with RAS:

- **Hypertension**
  - Severe, progressive and/or difficult to control
  - Absence of family history of hypertension
- **Unexplained kidney dysfunction**
- **Sudden or unexplained recurrent pulmonary oedema**

### Risk Factors

Strong risk factors associated with RAS include:

- Dyslipidaemia
- Smoking
- Diabetes 

### Examination Findings

Common examination findings associated with RAS include:

- Hypertension
- Abdominal bruit

### Causes of RAS

The two main causes of RAS are **atherosclerosis** and **fibromuscular dysplasia**. Factors associated with each offer suggestions of the underlying aetiology:

- **Atherosclerosis**
  - Onset of hypertension `>55` years
  - History of coronary artery disease
  - History of peripheral vascular disease
- **Fibromuscular dysplasia**
  - Onset of hypertension `<30` years 

### Severity of Stenosis

Severity of stenosis can be divided into three categories:

- **Moderate stenosis**: `50-70%` reduction in vessel diameter
- **Severe stenosis**: `>70%` reduction in vessel diameter
- **Total occlusion**: `100%` reduction in vessel diameter

## Investigations

### General First-Line Investigations

- **Serum creatinine**: To provide an estimate of GFR, will be normal or elevated if RAS is present.
- **Serum potassium**: Hypokalaemia may suggest RAS due to activation of the renin-angiotensin system.
- **Urinalysis and sediment evaluation**: Provides evaluation for the source of kidney disease; in absence of co-existing diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive glomerulosclerosis, RAS is associated with a normal result.
- **Aldosterone-to-renin ratio**: Excludes primary aldosteronism as a cause of hypertension and hypokalaemia if result is `<20`.

### Imaging Modalities

Imaging provides a conclusive diagnosis after suggestive first-line investigations; however, controversy exists regarding which imaging modality is the most appropriate. 

In patients with a high clinical probability of RAS, non-invasive imaging is initially recommended:

1. **1st line imaging**: Duplex ultrasound with diagnostic criteria of:
   - Renal artery to aorta peak systolic velocity ratio `>3.5`
   - Peak systolic velocity `>200` cm/sec with evidence of post-stenotic turbulence
   - End-diastolic velocity `>150` cm/sec
   - Renal resistive index `>0.8`
2. Followed, if necessary, in non-CKD patients, by the following options:
   - CT angiography
   - MR angiography
   - Captopril renal scan
3. Followed, if necessary, in CKD patients, by:
   - Non-contrast MR angiography 

If the results of non-invasive imaging modalities are inconclusive and the clinical suspicion for RAS is high, invasive testing is recommended:

- **Conventional angiography**
  - The most sensitive and specific test for assessment of RAS
  - Allows for concurrent therapeutic interventions
  - Requires arterial catheterisation and contrast utilisation

## Management (Prescribing)

Regardless of aetiology, the majority of patients with RAS have refractory or difficult to control hypertension and, therefore, primarily require optimisation of hypertensive therapy with a target BP of `<130/80 mmHg`.

- **1st line**: captopril/enalapril/valsartan/losartan
- **Secondary options**: hydrochlorothiazide/furosemide/atenolol/amlodipine/nifedipine/prazosin
- **Tertiary options**: clonidine/hydralazine/methyldopa/minoxidil

### Treatment by Aetiology

#### Atherosclerosis

- **1st line**
  - Antihypertensive therapy
  - Statin – atorvastatin/fluvastatin/lovastatin/rosuvastatin/simvastatin
  - Antiplatelet agent – aspirin 70-300 mg OD
- **2nd line**
  - If renal artery stent inserted - clopidogrel 75 mg OD

#### Fibromuscular Dysplasia

- **1st line**
  - Antihypertensive therapy
  - Percutaneous renal artery balloon angioplasty
- **2nd line**
  - If renal artery stent inserted - aspirin 70-300 mg OD + clopidogrel 75 mg OD

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Lifestyle modifications are recommended for all patients regardless of aetiology, including:

- Low-salt diet 
- Weight reduction 
- Smoking cessation 
- Optimisation of glycaemic control

Percutaneous renal artery balloon angioplasty should be recommended as first-line treatment in addition to antihypertensive therapy in all patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, as it is often curative.

<details>
<summary>Indications for Renal Artery Stenting</summary>

Renal artery stenting can be considered in patients regardless of aetiology as a 2nd line treatment option if one of the following circumstances applies:

- Refractory hypertension exists despite the use of >3 antihypertensive medications
- Progressive chronic kidney disease is present
- Acute kidney injury whilst taking ACEi/ARB in patients with congestive heart failure
- Recurrent flash pulmonary oedema
- Bilateral RAS
- RAS present in a single functioning kidney 

</details>

### Surgical Reconstruction

Surgical reconstruction of the renal arteries is only considered as a 3rd line treatment option if the patient is undergoing major aortic reconstruction for another reason (e.g., abdominal aortic aneurysm repair).
