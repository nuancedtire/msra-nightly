# Primary Aldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome)

Primary aldosteronism (PA), eponymously named Conn’s syndrome, is a disorder in which **aldosterone production exceeds the body’s requirements**. This condition is relatively independent of its normal regulators, namely the renin-angiotensin II system. The consequence of this overproduction leads to:

- Excessive sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron
- Hypertension
- Suppression of renin-angiotensin II

In chronic and severe cases, **urinary loss** of potassium and hydrogen exchanged for sodium at the distal nephron can result in:

- **Hypokalaemia**
- **Metabolic alkalosis**

## Diagnosis

Primary aldosteronism should be considered an important diagnosis for **all patients with hypertension**, regardless of severity or serum potassium levels. Key diagnostic points include:

- Most patients with PA are **normokalaemic**, but if symptoms of hypokalaemia are present, the likelihood of PA increases.

Common symptoms of hypokalaemia include:

- Muscle weakness
- Paraesthesia
- Muscle cramps
- Nocturia
- Polyuria
- Palpitations

Other associated signs that may be present include:

- Lethargy
- Difficulty concentrating 
- Mood disturbances (irritability, anxiety, and depression)

Common **risk factors** associated with primary aldosteronism include:

- Age between **20-70 years**
- Family history of PA or early-onset hypertension and/or stroke 

## Investigations

### 1st Line Investigations:

- **Plasma potassium**
  - Low levels occur in approximately 20% of patients with PA
  - Generally a poor screening test but can serve as a useful clue when signs are present
  - Precautions must be taken to avoid false elevations that mask true hypokalaemia

- **Aldosterone/renin ratio**
  - The most reliable available screening test
  - Ratio becomes elevated before plasma aldosterone or potassium levels leave their normal ranges
  - Caution is necessary due to potential false positives and negatives, especially with diuretic use or time of day

### Investigations to Consider:

- **Fludrocortisone suppression test**
  - Widely regarded as the most reliable method to confirm or exclude PA
- **Saline infusion testing**
  - An alternative to fludrocortisone testing for definitive confirmation or exclusion of PA
- **Oral salt loading**
  - Another alternative for confirming or excluding PA
  - Issues may arise regarding the completeness of urine collection and measurement accuracy
- **Adrenal venous sampling**
  - Identifies unilateral or bilateral adrenal hyperaldosteronism
    - **Unilateral causes**: aldosterone-producing adenoma/carcinoma, unilateral adrenal hyperplasia
    - **Bilateral causes**: bilateral adrenal hyperplasia 
- **Genetic testing**
  - Useful in subtype determination of PA
- **Adrenal CT scan**
  - Recommended for patients negative for hybrid gene
  - Typically detects aldosterone-producing carcinomas (>3 cm) but frequently misses aldosterone-producing adenomas (~1 cm)

## Management (Prescribing)

Management should incorporate results from adrenal venous sampling and other diagnostic procedures, along with patient preferences. **Medical management** is typically employed in patients without lateralized aldosterone production or those who prefer medical therapy over surgical options. Therapeutic pathways may vary based on familial hyperaldosteronism type:

### Non-Familial Hyperaldosteronism Type 1

- **1st line**: Aldosterone antagonists such as **amiloride**, **spironolactone**, or **eplerenone**
  - Be cautious of over-treatment, which may lead to volume contraction with pre-renal failure, increased creatinine levels, and **life-threatening hyperkalaemia**. Concurrent potassium-wasting diuretics can be beneficial, but potassium and creatinine levels must be closely monitored.

### Familial Hyperaldosteronism Type 1

- **1st line**: Glucocorticoids like **dexamethasone** or **prednisolone** 
  - These are used to rapidly manage hypertension.
- **2nd line**: Aldosterone antagonists such as **amiloride**, **spironolactone**, or **eplerenone**

Preoperatively, those opting for surgery can be optimized by controlling hypertension, restoring potassium levels, and antagonizing the effects of excess aldosterone.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Approximately 30% of patients with PA, upon adrenal venous sampling investigation, will show lateralization indicative of **unilateral aldosterone production**. These patients are candidates for **unilateral adrenalectomy**, which has been shown to:

- Cure hypertension in approximately **55% of cases**
- Significantly improve the remainder's blood pressure
- Correct hypokalaemia in the vast majority

In rare cases of bilateral adrenal disease, a unilateral adrenalectomy may still be considered. In such scenarios, the doses of aldosterone-blocking drugs will be lowered, thus minimizing adverse effects.

_Pre-surgery protocol_:

- Discontinue potassium supplementation and aldosterone antagonists.
- Wean off antihypertensive therapy if appropriate.

Approximately 20% of patients diagnosed with unilateral PA may continue to show signs of PA postoperatively. If hypertension persists due to aldosterone excess, it may respond to medical aldosterone antagonist therapy. Note that BP may continue to decline for weeks, so postoperative medication can often be delayed.

  {
    question: "A 55-year-old male presents with resistant hypertension and mild hypokalaemia. His blood pressure has not improved despite multiple antihypertensive medications. Which of the following is the best initial screening test for primary aldosteronism?",
    options: [
      "Plasma aldosterone concentration",
      "Aldosterone/renin ratio",
      "Plasma potassium level",
      "Saline infusion test",
      "Adrenal CT scan"

    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The aldosterone/renin ratio is the most reliable screening test for primary aldosteronism and is commonly preferred due to its high sensitivity and specificity. If hypokalaemia is present, this test could indicate PA even if the plasma potassium level is normal.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that the first step in screening for primary aldosteronism is to assess the aldosterone/renin ratio. While plasma potassium can provide some information, it is not a definitive test for PA."
