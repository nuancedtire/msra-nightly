# Cushing's Syndrome

Cushing’s Syndrome is an endocrine disorder characterized by **high levels of cortisol** in the blood. The causes of this syndrome can be classified into two main categories: **ACTH dependent** and **ACTH independent**.

## Causes

### ACTH Dependent
(HPA axis = low CRH, high ACTH, and high cortisol)

- **Pituitary adenoma**: Approximately five times more common in males; often due to a microadenoma. This condition is also known as *Cushing’s disease*.
- **Ectopic ACTH secretion**: Commonly observed in conditions such as small cell lung carcinoma.

### ACTH Independent
(HPA axis = low CRH, low ACTH, and high cortisol)

- **Exogenous**: The most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome, typically resulting from glucocorticoid therapy.
- **Adrenal adenoma**
- **Adrenal carcinoma**
- **Micronodular adrenal dysplasia**: A very rare condition.
- **Carney complex syndrome**

## Diagnosis

Cushing’s syndrome is most commonly diagnosed in individuals aged **20-40 years**. It is estimated that **10-15 per million people** are affected annually.

### Common Signs and Symptoms at Presentation
- Hypertension
- Weight gain
- Fatigue
- Round, red, ruddy face
- Poor concentration and short-term memory
- Menstrual irregularity
- Excessive hair growth in women

<details>
<summary>Unusual Presentations</summary>
- Depression
- Acne
- Insomnia
- Thin skin and **striae**
- Recurrent infections
- Fractures due to osteoporosis
- Muscle wasting
- Truncal obesity and buffalo hump
- Diabetes mellitus
- Growth retardation in children
- Skin pigmentation in Cushing’s disease
</details>

### Differential Diagnoses
- Alcoholism
- Obesity
- Depression
- Anorexia
- Nelson’s syndrome

**Important Note**: Some patients may present without any obvious signs or symptoms, complicating diagnosis.

## Investigations

Clinical investigations are critical for confirming the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome and localizing its cause. 

### Confirming Cushing’s Syndrome
- **24-hour urinary cortisol**: Elevated cortisol levels indicate Cushing’s.
- **Low dose dexamethasone suppression test**: Cortisol levels remain unchanged in endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.

### Localizing Tests
- **ACTH Plasma Levels**:
  - **Low ACTH**: Indicates adrenal adenomas or carcinomas (ACTH independent).
  - **High ACTH**: Suggests Cushing’s disease and ectopic ACTH production (ACTH dependent).
- **High dose dexamethasone suppression test**:
  - Reduction in cortisol levels indicates an ACTH dependent pituitary tumor.
  - No change suggests either ACTH independent or ACTH dependent ectopic tumor.
- **CRH stimulation** and **petrosal sinus sampling** may be employed to differentiate between ectopic and pituitary ACTH secretion.

### Imaging
- **MRI**: Targeted at pituitary tumors.
- **CT scans**: Useful for assessing adrenal glands, as well as chest, abdomen, and pelvis tumors.

## Management

### Prescribing Management
- Without intervention, patients face serious complications, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, infections, and increased mortality.
- For cases caused by **exogenous steroid therapy**, a **gradual titration** down of dosage is advised to alleviate symptoms while preventing withdrawal and adrenal crisis.
- Medications such as **ketoconazole** and **metyrapone** can control plasma cortisol levels before surgery if adrenal carcinoma is present or if there is ectopic ACTH production.

### Non-Prescribing Management
- The most effective approach involves **surgical removal** of the causative factor, often a tumor. 
- **Radiotherapy** may be employed post-surgery in cancerous cases.
- The **trans-sphenoidal removal** of the pituitary adenoma is considered the gold-standard treatment for Cushing’s disease.

  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman presents with weight gain, hypertension, and a round, ruddy face. Laboratory tests reveal elevated 24-hour urinary cortisol levels. Which additional test would be most useful to determine if her Cushing's syndrome is ACTH dependent or independent?",
    options: [
      "Low dose dexamethasone suppression test",
      "CRH stimulation test",
      "24-hour plasma ACTH levels",
      "MRI of the pituitary gland",
      "CT scan of the abdomen"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Measuring 24-hour plasma ACTH levels can help determine whether the Cushing's syndrome is ACTH dependent (high ACTH) or ACTH independent (low ACTH), guiding further management.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about how ACTH levels can help distinguish between different causes of Cushing's syndrome. Which tests measure ACTH levels directly, and what information can you gather from those results?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 40-year-old man with newly diagnosed hypertension and truncal obesity is suspected to have Cushing's syndrome. Which of the following findings would most strongly suggest an adrenal source of his condition?",
    options: [
      "Elevated ACTH levels",
      "Suppressed cortisol levels after low dose dexamethasone",
      "Low ACTH levels",
      "Increased cortisol levels after CRH stimulation",
      "Positive petrosal sinus sampling"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Low ACTH levels indicate that the source of cortisol is likely coming from an adrenal mass (independent of ACTH), suggesting either an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the relationship between cortisol and ACTH levels in Cushing's syndrome. Which hormone level is indicative of adrenal involvement versus pituitary or ectopic causes?"
  },
  {
    question: "During the management of a patient with Cushing's syndrome caused by an adrenal adenoma, which pharmacological agent may be used to control hypercortisolism preoperatively?",
    options: [
      "Metyrapone",
      "Cortisol",
      "Dexamethasone",
      "Hydrocortisone",
      "Clonidine"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Metyrapone is used to control plasma cortisol levels by inhibiting cortisol synthesis, especially when preparing patients for surgery.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the mechanisms of various medications. Which of the listed agents directly affects cortisol synthesis rather than replacing or suppressing existing cortisol?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 29-year-old woman undergoes transsphenoidal surgery for a pituitary adenoma causing Cushing's disease. What is the most common postoperative complication she should be monitored for?",
