# De Quervain’s Thyroiditis

De Quervain’s thyroiditis (also known as subacute granulomatous thyroiditis) is an inflammatory thyroid disease characterized by three phases that occur over weeks to months:

- **Transient thyrotoxicosis**
- **Hypothyroidism**
- **Return to normal thyroid function in >90% of patients**

The exact aetiology remains unclear, but it is presumed to be viral in origin.

## Diagnosis

The clinical symptoms vary depending on the phase of the disease. Most patients present during the thyrotoxicosis phase and may exhibit the following clinical features:

- Sudden onset of a viral-like illness
- Fever `>38°C`
- Myalgia
- Malaise
- Pharyngitis (notable for its association with viral disease)
- Palpitations (tachycardia on examination)
- Tremor
- Heat intolerance
- **Thyroid pain**
  - Neck pain that worsens over days, evolving into severe anterior neck pain overlying the thyroid gland
  - May radiate to the jaw or ears
  - Can mimic pain caused by tooth, upper respiratory tract, or ear infections 
  - Often associated with an enlarged and firm thyroid gland

In the hypothyroid phase, patients typically present asymptomatically, with abnormal blood test results.

## Investigations

If De Quervain’s thyroiditis is suspected, the following investigations should be performed initially:

- **Thyroid function blood tests (TFTs)**
  - Thyrotoxicosis: very low TSH, high T4 and T3 (T3:T4 ratio is generally `<15:1`)
  - Hypothyroid: high but variable TSH, slightly low T4 and T3
  - Recovery: TSH, T4, and T3 returning to normal
- **Radioiodine uptake test** is the most reliable method to confirm De Quervain’s thyroiditis
  - Thyrotoxicosis: very low uptake (`1-3%` over `24 hours`) and cannot image thyroid.
  - Note: Other causes of thyroid pain (e.g., infection) may show normal TFTs and a normal radioactive iodine uptake test.

*Note that ESR and CRP may be elevated but are not specific to De Quervain’s thyroiditis.*

Biopsy via fine-needle aspiration is usually not necessary unless clinical findings suggest De Quervain’s thyroiditis, but TFTs or radioiodine uptake tests do not confirm it.

## Management (Prescribing)

Management focuses on symptom relief, especially during the thyrotoxic phase where symptoms can be significant. 

For the thyrotoxic phase, medications include:

- **Analgesics** such as NSAIDs to relieve thyroid pain.
- **High-dose corticosteroids** can be used if NSAIDs do not adequately relieve severe pain.
- **Beta-blockers** (first line) and **calcium channel blockers** (second line, e.g., if beta-blockers are contraindicated) to treat tachycardia, anxiety, or tremor. 
  - Patients should be well-hydrated.
- **Potassium iodine + prednisolone** may be used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. This combination inhibits T3 formation from T4.

For the hypothyroid phase, medications include:

- **Levothyroxine** if symptoms significantly affect quality of life or if moderate disease is present (TSH `>15 microunits/ml`).

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Many patients with De Quervain’s thyroiditis do not require treatment. During the hypothyroid phase, TSH levels and symptoms should be assessed every `4-6 weeks`. Complete recovery is observed in `≥90%` of patients, and no long-term monitoring is necessary after recovery.

**Important:** Ensure symptomatic treatment is prioritized during the thyrotoxic phase to avoid complications.

  {
    question: "A 45-year-old man presents with fever, myalgia, and severe anterior neck pain that worsened over several days. Thyroid function tests show very low TSH and high T4. He is diagnosed with De Quervain’s thyroiditis. Which of the following findings is most likely to be present during the thyrotoxic phase?",
    options: [
      "Elevated ESR and CRP with low radioiodine uptake",
      "Normal TSH and elevated T3 and T4",
      "High uptake on radioiodine test and elevated TSH",
      "Low radioiodine uptake and high TSH",
      "Low radioiodine uptake and very high ESR"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! During the thyrotoxic phase of De Quervain’s thyroiditis, the radioiodine uptake is very low due to suppressed function of the thyroid gland, while the ESR and CRP can be elevated. The significant presence of thyroid pain alongside these blood test results reinforces the diagnosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the typical findings associated with De Quervain’s thyroiditis during its thyrotoxic phase. Pay special attention to how radioiodine uptake works and what lab values would be consistent with thyrotoxicosis."
  },
  {
    question: "In the hypothyroid phase of De Quervain’s thyroiditis, a patient is found to have a TSH level of 18 microunits/ml. What is the most appropriate management for this patient?",
    options: [
      "No treatment is necessary; monitor TSH levels",
      "Prescribe high-dose corticosteroids immediately",
      "Initiate levothyroxine therapy",
      "Start potassium iodine therapy",
      "Advise the patient to increase dietary iodine"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In cases of hypothyroidism associated with De Quervain’s thyroiditis that significantly affect quality of life or with a moderate elevation in TSH (>15 microunits/ml), levothyroxine is the appropriate treatment to restore normal thyroid hormone levels.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the phases of De Quervain's thyroiditis and when intervention is necessary. What symptoms or laboratory findings would indicate the need for initiating thyroid hormone replacement therapy?"

  {
    question: "A patient with De Quervain’s thyroiditis is experiencing severe thyroid pain that is not relieved by NSAIDs. What would be the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Prescribe oral beta-blockers",
      "Administer high-dose corticosteroids",
      "Refer for surgical intervention",
      "Start potassium iodine therapy",
      "Monitor symptoms with scheduled follow-up"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! When severe thyroid pain is present and not effectively managed by NSAIDs, high-dose corticosteroids can provide significant relief of inflammation and pain associated with De Quervain’s thyroiditis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the treatment options available for managing severe pain in De Quervain’s thyroiditis. What is the next step when NSAIDs fail to manage symptoms?"
