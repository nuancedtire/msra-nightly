# Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of inherited enzyme deficiencies that result in impairment of corticosteroid synthesis by the adrenal cortex. The most common enzyme deficiency, accounting for over 90% of cases, is **21-hydroxylase deficiency**. CAH can be classified into:

- **Classical** (simple virilising or salt-wasting types)
- **Non-classical**

Other enzyme deficiencies resulting in CAH include:

- **17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency**
- **11-beta hydroxylase deficiency**
- **3-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency**

## Diagnosis

### Classical Simple Virilising CAH

- **Females**: Diagnosed at birth due to apparent genital ambiguity.
- **Males**: Born with unaffected external genitalia; only hyperpigmentation may suggest increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormones (**ACTH**).
- **Diagnosis**: Can be made through antenatal or newborn screening.
- **Positive Family History**: Common.
  
**Signs of Hyperandrogenism include:**

- Precocious puberty
- Rapid somatic growth, leading to short adult stature despite tall childhood growth
- Infertility
- Temporal balding
- Severe acne
- Hirsutism

### Classical Salt-Wasting CAH

- Infants present with renal salt-wasting in addition to hyperandrogenism symptoms.

**Symptoms of Renal Salt-Wasting include:**

- Poor feeding
- Weight loss
- Failure to thrive
- Vomiting
- Dehydration
- Hypotension
- Hyponatremia 
- Hyperkalemia
- Metabolic acidosis progressing to adrenal crisis (can occur as early as `1 to 4 weeks` of age)

### Non-Classical CAH

- **Positive Family History**: Common.
  
**Symptoms include:**

- Acne
- Premature development of pubic hair
- Accelerated growth
- Advanced bone age
- Reduced adult stature

- **Females**: Normal genitalia at birth; postnatal symptoms may include hirsutism, temporal baldness, delayed menarche, menstrual irregularities, and infertility.
- **Males**: Early beard growth, enlarged phallus with relatively small testes. Symptoms can be limited to short stature and diminished fertility.

## Investigations

1st line investigations to consider include:

- **Rapid ACTH Stimulation Test**: If medical and family history and physical exam suggest 21-hydroxylase deficiency, levels should remain high before and after stimulation in the classical form.
- **Serum 17-Hydroprogesterone**: Elevated for age in the classical form; less raised in the non-classical form.
- **Serum 11-Deoxycortisol**: Most robust chemical marker for diagnosing 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, results will be elevated for age.
- **Serum Chemistry**: Useful for newborns and infants with ambiguous genitalia or at risk for 21-hydroxylase-deficient CAH, illustrating hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis.
- **Genetic Analysis**: Strongly recommended if there is a family history of the disease or one of the future parents has the disease.

## Management (Prescribing)

### Chronic Management

The standard treatment for both classical and non-classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency is **glucocorticoid replacement therapy**, most commonly in the form of hydrocortisone. This therapy:

- Corrects the deficiency in cortisol secretion.
- Suppresses ACTH overproduction.
  
Proper treatment prevents virilization and allows normal growth and development. Following completion of linear growth, more potent glucocorticoids such as **prednisolone** and **dexamethasone** can be used.

In addition to glucocorticoid therapy:

- **Mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone) and sodium chloride therapy** is necessary in the salt-wasting form. Sodium chloride supplementation may not be required after infancy. Similarly, mineralocorticoid therapy may decrease with age.
  
Despite optimal management, short stature is often associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Therefore, **growth hormone therapy**, either alone or in combination with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues, is effective in improving final height.

True precocious puberty can additionally be treated with analogues of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone.

### Acute Management

- **Increased doses of glucocorticoids** are required in periods of stress (surgery, febrile illness, shock), typically `2 to 3 times normal dose`.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

In females with classical CAH who are virilised at birth, **feminising genitoplasty** may be undertaken to remove redundant erectile tissue while preserving the gland clitoris. The procedure aims to provide a normal vaginal orifice that functions adequately for menstruation, intromission, and delivery.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 4-week-old infant is brought to the emergency department due to poor feeding, weight loss, and vomiting. Physical examination reveals dehydration and hypotension. Laboratory tests show hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Non-classical CAH",
      "Classical Simple Virilising CAH",
      "Classic Salt-Wasting CAH",
      "17-alpha Hydroxylase Deficiency",
      "11-beta Hydroxylase Deficiency"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presentation—poor feeding, weight loss, vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia—aligns with Classical Salt-Wasting CAH. This condition is characterized by adrenal insufficiency leading to severe electrolyte imbalances and adrenal crisis, typically presenting in infancy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the age of the infant and the symptoms presented. The combination of electrolyte imbalances and acute symptoms suggests a form of adrenal crisis. Which condition typically presents with these severe symptoms in infants? Consider the types of CAH and their manifestations."
  },
  {
    question: "A girl with classical CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents at the age of 6 years with accelerated growth and advanced bone age. What is the primary treatment goal for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Complete androgen suppression",
      "Growth hormone therapy",
      "Normalization of cortisol secretion",
      "Prevention of mineralocorticoid deficiency",
      "Achieving normal adult height"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 5,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The primary treatment goal in patients with classical CAH is to normalize growth and achieve a final height close to genetic potential. By managing glucocorticoid therapy effectively, you can limit the effects of excess androgens and allow for proper growth.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While all treatments are significant, consider the long-term management in a pediatric patient. Especially in cases of accelerated growth, think about how to balance the effects of hormones to maximize final adult height. What does management strive to achieve in terms of growth?"
  },

    ],
    correctAnswer: 5,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid used to replace the deficient aldosterone in patients with classical salt-wasting CAH, thereby helping to maintain sodium balance and prevent dehydration and hypotension.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the specific role of fludrocortisone in the treatment of CAH. Is it related more to glucocorticoid deficiency or mineralocorticoid deficiency? What condition does it primarily address within the adrenal hormone deficiency spectrum?"
