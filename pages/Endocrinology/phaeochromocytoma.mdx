# Phaeochromocytoma: Diagnosis and Management

## Overview

Phaeochromocytomas are tumours that arise from the **catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells** of the adrenal medulla. These tumours are primarily benign and often develop sporadically; however, up to **40%** of cases can be due to hereditary syndromes such as **multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2** or **Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome**.

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Presentation

There can be large variations in clinical presentation, and `10-15%` of cases can be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during investigations. The **classic triad** of symptoms includes:

- **Palpitations**
- **Headaches**
- **Diaphoresis** (excessive sweating)

Typically, symptoms occur in episodes ranging from **minutes to hours**, worsening as the tumour enlarges. 

### Key Findings on Examination

- **Hypertension** (sustained or paroxysmal, often refractory to multiple drug regimens)
- **Pallor**
- **Tremors**
- **Tachycardia**
- **Abdominal masses**

### Family History Considerations

Enquiring into a patientâ€™s family history is crucial since up to **40%** of phaeochromocytoma cases in adults are hereditary. Family syndromes with strong associations include:

- Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome type 2A and B
- Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease
- Germline mutations in the **succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)** subunit B, C, and D genes
- Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)

### Associated Endocrine Disorders

Endocrine disorders which may result from having a phaeochromocytoma include:

- **Cushing syndrome**
- **Impaired glucose tolerance**
- **Diabetes**

## Investigations

All patients presenting with the classic triad of symptoms or known predisposing familial disorders should undergo investigations. There is no consensus on a definitive diagnostic test; hence, the choice of biochemical testing should be based on **pre-test probability**.

### Biochemical Testing

- **Low pre-test probability:** Offer 24-hour urine collection for **catecholamines**, **metanephrines**, **normetanephrines**, and **creatinine**. Ideally during or after a hypertensive crisis.
  
- **High pre-test probability:** Offer serum **metanephrines** and **normetanephrines**. Patients should refrain from strenuous exercise, tobacco, caffeine, and certain medications prior to testing.

#### Clonidine Suppression Test

In cases where false positives may occur, a **clonidine suppression test** can be utilized. A diagnosis is indicated if no suppression of plasma catecholamines occurs `3 hours` after clonidine administration.

### Imaging

After biochemical confirmation, a **CT scan** of the abdomen and pelvis is performed to anatomically localize the tumour. Inhomogeneous masses on CT imaging suggest the tumour's position.

## Management (Prescribing)

The main goal of treatment is to mitigate the harmful effects of excess catecholamine production. Medical management should be employed pre-operatively and continued post-operatively if surgical interventions are unsuccessful.

### Initial Management for Hypertensive Crisis

If a patient presents in hypertensive crisis (`systolic BP >250 mmHg`), consider administering:

- **Phentolamine**: `5-20 mg IV` as a single dose, or 
- **Sodium nitroprusside** (IV).

### Medical Management

For patients without hypertensive crisis:

#### Antihypertensive Therapy

- **Alpha-blockers** to control hypertension:
  - **First line**: **Phenoxybenzamine**
  - **Secondary options**: **Doxazosin** or **Prazosin**

- **Beta-blockers** to prevent tachycardia and arrhythmias:
  - **First line**: **Atenolol**, **Metoprolol**, or **Propranolol**
  - **Secondary option**: **Labetalol**

- **Calcium-channel blockers** as adjunct therapy:
  - **First line**: **Nifedipine** or **Amlodipine**
  - **Secondary option**: **Mertirosine** (tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor)

### Chemotherapy Agents

For patients who have undergone surgery or are unable to undergo surgery, consider the following primary chemotherapy agents:

- **Cyclophosphamide**
- **Vincristine**
- **Dacarbazine**

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Laparoscopic surgical excision of the entire adrenal gland remains the mainstay of treatment for benign phaeochromocytomas, achieving a cure in over **85%** of cases. In instances of bilateral disease, adrenal-sparing techniques may be employed.

### Metastatic Disease

For **metastatic disease** (affecting `10%` of all catecholamine-secreting tumours), surgical removal or debulking is the primary therapy, although this may depend on the extent of local and metastatic spread. Consider external beam radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation for hepatic and bone involvement.

### Hereditary Phaeochromocytoma

In patients with hereditary phaeochromocytoma, **cortical-sparing adrenalectomy** is the preferred option to avoid lifelong corticosteroid therapy. However, diligent postoperative monitoring is essential for recurrence.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old male with a known phaeochromocytoma presents with severe hypertension and chest pain. After initial stabilization, which of the following is the most appropriate medication to initiate for long-term control of his hypertension?",
    options: [
      "Propranolol",
      "Phenoxybenzamine",
      "Labetalol",
      "Amlodipine",
      "Nitroglycerin"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Phenoxybenzamine is the first-line treatment for managing hypertension associated with phaeochromocytoma due to its non-selective irreversible alpha-adrenergic blockade, which effectively reduces catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction. This medication is essential in managing symptoms and preventing hypertensive crises. The other options are not first-line for this specific scenario.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the underlying mechanism of hypertension in phaeochromocytoma. Which medication targets this mechanism specifically and provides long-term control? Consider the role of alpha-blockade versus beta-blockade in this condition."
  },
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman with a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is found to have a pheochromocytoma. Which of the following genetic screenings is recommended to identify potential hereditary factors?",
    options: [
      "Testing for RET proto-oncogene mutations",
      "Testing for VHL mutations",
      "Testing for SDHB mutations",
      "Testing for NF1 mutations",
      "Testing for MEN1 mutations"
    ],
