# Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is an **autoimmune**, **metabolic disease** characterized by *chronic elevated blood glucose levels*, known as **hyperglycaemia**. In T1DM, autoantibodies target the insulin-producing **beta cells** in the pancreas, leading to the destruction of 80-90% of these cells by autoreactive **T cells**, causing absolute insulin deficiency and increased blood glucose levels.

## Epidemiology

- T1DM accounts for approximately **5-10%** of all diabetic patients.
- Onset usually peaks at ages **4-6** years and **10-14** years.
- It is generally diagnosed before the age of **20**, but may occur at any age.
- Associated with **HLA-DR3** and **HLA-DR4** and other autoimmune conditions:
  - Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis
  - Type A gastritis
  - Coeliac disease
  - Primary adrenal insufficiency

## Complications

T1DM is a chronic and progressive disease that can result in various complications, prompting the importance of regular monitoring and good glycaemic control.

### Classifications of Complications

1. **Macrovascular Disease** (more common in T2DM)
   - Coronary heart disease
   - Peripheral arterial disease
   - Cerebrovascular disease
2. **Microvascular Disease** (arises 5-10 years after onset)
   - Diabetic **nephropathy**
   - **Retinopathy**
   - **Neuropathy**
   - **Diabetic foot**

## Diagnosis

DKA may be the first manifestation. A classic presentation of hyperglycaemia in T1DM includes:

- **Polyuria** (excess urination)
- **Polydipsia** (excess thirst)
- **Polyphagia** (excess hunger)
- **Weight loss**

*Nonspecific features* may include:

- Fatigue
- Visual disturbances
- Calf cramps
- Poor wound healing
- Pruritus

### Diagnostic Criteria (WHO)

- **Symptomatic**: 
  - Symptoms of hyperglycaemia AND raised venous glucose detected once: fasting `>7mmol/l` or random `>11.1mmol/l`
- **Asymptomatic**:
  - Raised venous glucose on 2 separate occasions:
    - Fasting `>7mmol/l` (impaired fasting glucose `5.6-6.9mmol/l`, healthy `<5.6mmol/l`)
    - OGTT 2-hour value `>11.1mmol/l` (impaired glucose tolerance `7.8-11.0mmol/l`, healthy `<7.8mmol/mol`)
    - HbA1C (glycated haemoglobin) `>48mmol/mol` or `6.5%` (prediabetes `39-46mmol/mol` `5.7-6.4%`, healthy `<39mmol/mol` `<5.7%`) 

## Investigations

According to WHO criteria, blood glucose measurements or an oral glucose tolerance test is required for diagnosis. A high HbA1C level can also diagnose T1DM.

### Additional Tests

- **Specific autoantibodies for T1DM**:
  - Anti-GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies
  - Anti-tyrosine phosphatase-related islet antigen (IA-2)
  - Islet cell surface antibody (ICSA; against ganglioside)
  
- **C-peptide**:
  - Low C-peptide levels indicate an absolute insulin deficiency, suggesting T1DM
  - High C-peptide levels may indicate insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, suggesting T2DM

- **Urine analysis**:
  - Microalbuminuria: an early sign of diabetic nephropathy
  - Glucosuria: presence of glucose in urine insufficient to establish diabetes mellitus
  - Ketone bodies: present in acute metabolic decompensation in T1DM (DKA) 

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

T1DM is associated with two main emergencies: **diabetic ketoacidosis** (DKA) and **hypoglycaemia**.

### Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

DKA is often the first manifestation of T1DM. 

#### Pathophysiology

- The body metabolizes carbohydrates to glucose, which is taken up into cells via insulin-mediated transport.
- In diabetics, there's an absolute lack of insulin, preventing glucose entry into cells, leading to a starvation-like state that favors ketoacidosis.

#### Common Triggers

- **4 â€˜Iâ€™s**:
  - Infection
  - Infarct (e.g., Myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular accident)
  - Inflammation (e.g., Pancreatitis)
  - Incorrect or non-compliance to insulin dosing

#### Typical Patient Presentation

- Gradual drowsiness
- Vomiting and dehydration
- Abdominal pain
- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Lethargy
- Anorexia
- Ketotic breath (fruity-scented)
- Coma
- Deep breathing (Kussmaul hyperventilation)

#### Diagnosis Criteria

1. Acidaemia â€“ venous blood pH `<7.3` or `HCO3- <15.0mmol/l`
2. Hyperglycaemia â€“ blood glucose `>11.0mmol/l` or known DM 
3. Ketonaemia â€“ `>3.0mmol/l` or significant ketonuria `>2+` on dipstick 

*Signs of severe DKA should warrant consideration of transfer to HDU/ICU for monitoring.*

### Management of DKA

1. **Resuscitation using the ABCDE approach**
   - 1L of `0.9% saline` over 1 hour if systolic blood pressure is `>90mm Hg`.
   - In hypotensive patients (`<90mm Hg`), administer a fluid challenge of `500ml bolus 0.9% saline` over 15 minutes.
   
2. **Insulin Therapy**
   - Start with `50 units of human soluble insulin` mixed with `50ml 0.9% saline`, infused continuously at `0.1 unit/kg/h`.
   
3. **Monitoring**
   - Check capillary blood glucose and ketones hourly.
   - Perform VBG (pH, HCO3-, K+) at `2h`, `4h`, `8h`, `12h`, and `24h`.

### Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia is the most common endocrine emergency defined as plasma glucose `<3mmol/l`. Prompt recognition and treatment are necessary to prevent brain damage or death.

#### Causes

- Insulin treatment
- Increased activity
- Missed meals
- Alcohol binge without carbohydrate consumption
- Insulin overdose (accidental or non-accidental)

#### Symptoms

- **Autonomic**: Sweating, anxiety, hunger, tremor, palpitations, dizziness
- **Neuroglycopaenic**: Confusion, drowsiness, visual problems, seizures, coma 
- **Focal symptoms**: Transient hemiplegia (rare)

#### Management

- If conscious and able to swallow, consume **15-20g** of quick-acting carbohydrates.
- If unable to swallow, family members should have sugary drinks or **GlucoGel** ready, or give IM **glucagon**.
- If symptoms persist, administer IV glucose or IV/IM **1g glucagon**.

### Management (Prescribing)

All patients with T1DM are started on **insulin**. 

#### Insulin Therapy

- Approximately **40 units** of total daily insulin is required: 
  - **20 units** for basal insulin 
  - **20 units** for bolus insulin

- Blood glucose targets:
  - 5-7mmol/L on waking
  - 4-7mmol/L before meals
  - 5-9mmol/L at least 90 minutes after eating.

### Insulin Regimens

- **BD Biphasic Regimen**: Twice-daily premixed insulin by pen.
- **QDS Regimen**: Ultra-fast insulin before meals + long-acting insulin at bedtime.
- **Insulin Pump**: Continuous subcutaneous insulin delivery for patients who struggle with previous regimens.

#### Adjustments in Insulin

Insulin adjustments may be necessary based on:

- *Physical activity*: Decrease insulin by **1-2 units** per **20-30 minutes** of activity.
- *Illness or stress*: Increased insulin demand; monitor more frequently.
- *Surgery*: Decrease insulin to **1/3-1/2** of the usual daily requirement.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

General management encompasses blood glucose control with insulin and glycaemic monitoring:

- **Lifestyle Advice**:
  - Smoking cessation
  - Balanced diet rich in low glycemic index foods
  - Regular exercise

**Monitoring**:

- Regular assessments of blood pressure, lipids, and renal parameters. 
- Blood pressure targets: `<135/85mm Hg` (or `<130/80mm Hg` if albuminuria/metabolic syndrome presents).
- Annual checks for microvascular complications.

<summary>Microvascular Complications Monitoring</summary>

- **Eye Examinations**:
  - After 5 years of T1DM or starting from age 12 to monitor for diabetic retinopathy.
  
- **Urine Testing**:
  - For microalbuminuria from age 12 (ACR `3-30mg/mmol`).

- **Foot Exams**:
  - To assess for peripheral neuropathy and ulcers; preventive footwear is essential.
