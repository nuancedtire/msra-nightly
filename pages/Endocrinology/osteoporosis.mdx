# Osteoporosis: Understanding Diagnosis and Management

Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by weakened bones, leading to an increased risk of fractures. It develops gradually and is particularly prevalent in the UK, affecting over 3 million individuals. Each year, more than 500,000 people experience fragility fractures requiring hospital treatment, with over 80% of hip fractures occurring in women aged > 50 years.

## Diagnosis

Osteoporosis is often undiagnosed until a fragility fracture occurs. A fragility fracture is defined as a fracture resulting from a force that would not typically result in a fracture in a healthy individual. Depending on the affected bone type, fractures may occur in various sites:

- **Trabecular Bone**: Commonly leads to crush vertebrae fractures.
- **Cortical Bone**: Often results in long bone fractures, such as of the femoral neck.

**Common Sites of Fragility Fractures**:
- Hip
- Spine
- Ribs
- Wrists

Osteoporosis diagnosis is primarily confirmed through measuring bone mineral density (BMD). The **gold standard** is a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, where a T-score of ≤ `-2.5` confirms osteoporosis.

### Risk Assessment for Osteoporosis

The following table summarizes the criteria recommended by [NICE](https://cks.nice.org.uk/osteoporosis-prevention-of-fragility-fractures#!scenario) for assessing osteoporosis risk:

| **Group** | **Criteria for Consideration** |
| --- | --- |
| **Women `≥ 65`** | Assess all |
| **Men `≥ 75`** | Assess all |
| **Women `50-64`** | - Previous osteoporotic fragility fracture<br/>- Current or frequent use of corticosteroids<br/>- History of falls<br/>- Low BMI<br/>- Smoker<br/>- Alcohol intake `>14 units/week`<br/>- Secondary causes: <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Hypogonadism, endocrine conditions (e.g., diabetes), malabsorption conditions, etc. |
| **Anyone `<50`** | - Current or frequent use of oral corticosteroids<br/>- Untreated premature menopause<br/>- Previous fragility fracture |
| **Anyone `<40`** | - High-dose corticosteroids `>7.5 mg` prednisolone daily for `≥3 months`<br/>- Previous fragility fracture of the spine, hip, forearm, or proximal humerus |
| **Consider Assessing** | - Individuals on SSRIs, antiepileptics, aromatase inhibitors, etc. |

## Risk Factors

### Non-modifiable Risk Factors
- Age
- Gender (Female)
- Ethnicity (Asian / European)
- Family history
- Previous fragility fracture

### Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors
- Alcohol consumption (`>4 units` daily)
- Low dietary calcium
- Immobility
- BMI `<22`

### Secondary Causes Risk Factors
- Long-term steroid usage (`>5 mg/day` for `>3 months`)
- Hyperthyroidism
- Hyperparathyroidism
- Other conditions (renal/liver failure, inflammatory diseases, etc.)

## Investigations

### DEXA Scan
The DEXA scan is the standard investigation for osteoporosis. Below is the table of T-scores and corresponding BMD levels:

| **T Score** | **Bone Mineral Density (BMD)** |
| --- | --- |
| `>0` | BMD better than the reference |
| `0` to `-1` | Normal BMD |
| `-1` to `-2.5` | Osteopenia; risk for developing osteoporosis |
| `≤-2.5` | Osteoporosis |

### Additional Guidelines for DEXA Scans
NICE guidelines on when to perform a DEXA scan include:
- Low-trauma fractures
- Women `≥65` years old or men `≥75` years old with risk factors
- Pre-treatment for long-term corticosteroids
- Osteopenia cases with fragility fractures

Blood results will typically be normal in osteoporosis cases. A bone biopsy is not necessary as it is invasive and unreliable.

## Management (Prescribing)

Several medications are commonly prescribed for osteoporosis:

### **1. Bisphosphonates**
- Examples: Alendronic acid, risedronic acid, zoledronic acid
- **Dosage**: Alendronate `10 mg/day` or `70 mg/week`
- **Advice**:
  - Administer on an empty stomach with water
  - Remain upright for `30 minutes` to prevent gastrointestinal side effects

**Side Effects**:
- Common: gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity
- Severe: dysphagia, osteonecrosis of the jaw

### **2. Strontium Ranelate**
- Alternative to bisphosphonates; reduces fracture rates.

### **3. Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)**
- Example: Raloxifene
- **Side Effects**: Hot flushes, increased risk of blood clots.

### **4. Parathyroid Hormones**
- Example: Teriparatide
- **Side Effects**: Nausea and vomiting.

### **5. Hormone Replacement Therapy**
- Prevents and treats osteoporosis in postmenopausal women but increases cardiovascular risks.

### **6. Testosterone Treatment**
- Beneficial for men with low testosterone levels.

### **7. Calcium and Vitamin D Supplements**
- Commonly used to complement other therapies.

## Management (Non-prescribing)

Lifestyle modifications play a critical role in preventing osteoporosis. Recommended practices include:

- Cessation of smoking and reduction of alcohol consumption.
- Engaging in regular weight-bearing and balance exercises.
- Consuming a diet rich in Vitamin D and Calcium; consider taking a daily supplement of `10 micrograms` of Vitamin D.
- Education on fall prevention techniques and home safety assessments.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old woman is evaluated for osteoporosis after a low-trauma wrist fracture. Her DEXA scan reveals a T-score of -2.8. Based on the NICE guidelines, which of the following risk factors would qualify her for osteoporosis assessment?",
    options: [
      "Age > 65 years",
      "History of a low-trauma fracture after age 50",
      "Current use of corticosteroids for 6 months",
      "All of the above"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Each of these risk factors contributes to the higher likelihood of osteoporosis and fragility fractures, aligning with NICE guidelines for considering osteoporosis assessments.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about how NICE criteria classify risk factors. Any previous low-trauma fractures in individuals over 50, corticosteroid use, and advanced age all increase the need for assessment. Consider whether one risk factor alone is sufficient compared to the collective impact of several."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with osteoporosis is prescribed alendronic acid. Which important instruction should the healthcare provider give regarding the administration of this medication?",
    options: [
      "Take it with food to enhance absorption",
      "Take it immediately before lying down to rest",
      "Take it with a large glass of water and remain upright for 30 minutes",
      "Take it at bedtime for maximum efficacy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Alendronic acid must be taken on an empty stomach with a full glass of water, and patients should remain upright for 30 minutes to minimize gastrointestinal irritation and enhance absorption.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the specific requirements for bisphosphonate administration. Reflect on the implications of food and position when taking medications meant for osteoporosis."
  },
  {

    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Bisphosphonates are the standard first-line treatment to reduce fracture risk in patients with established osteoporosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the traditional management strategies for osteoporosis. Reviewing the distinctions between these options may help clarify which is typically recommended immediately after a fracture."
  },
  {

    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a serious but less common side effect of bisphosphonates that warrants monitoring, especially in patients undergoing dental procedures.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider common side effects associated with osteoporosis treatment. Reflect on the pharmacological mechanisms and known complications of the medications prescribed for this condition."
