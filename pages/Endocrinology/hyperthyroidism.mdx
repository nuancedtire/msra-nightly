# Hyperthyroidism: Clinical Manifestations, Diagnosis, and Management

## Overview of Hyperthyroidism

A variety of underlying diseases can cause **hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis)**; however, the clinical manifestations are largely independent of the cause. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in countries with sufficient iodine intake is due to **Graves’ disease**, an autoimmune thyroid condition. 

### Classical Symptoms
Patients with hyperthyroidism may present with a dramatic constellation of classical symptoms, including:

- **Heat intolerance**
- **Tremor**
- **Palpitations**
- **Anxiety**
- **Weight loss** (despite normal intake)
- **Increased frequency of bowel movements**
- **Shortness of breath**

## Diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism

The presenting symptoms which raise suspicion of hyperthyroidism can be divided into their effects on specific organ systems.

### Skin
- Warm and rarely erythematous – due to increased blood flow
- Smooth – due to decreased keratin layer
- Increased sweating – associated with heat intolerance
- Oncholysis (loosening of nails from nail bed) and nail softening
- Hyperpigmentation in severe cases – due to increased cortisol metabolism
- Thinning of hair

### Eyes
- **Stare and lid lag** – due to sympathetic overactivity

### Cardiovascular
- Increased cardiac output – increases peripheral oxygenation need
- **Systolic hypertension** is common
- Atrial fibrillation occurs in 10-20% of patients, more commonly in older populations

### Bone
- Thyroid hormone stimulates bone reabsorption; therefore, osteoporosis and increased fracture risk are present in patients with chronic hyperthyroidism.

### Respiratory
- **Dyspnea** may occur for several reasons:
  - Increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production
  - Respiratory muscle weakness
  - Tracheal obstruction from a large goiter
  - Exacerbation of underlying asthma
  - Increased pulmonary arterial systolic pressure

### Gastrointestinal
- **Weight loss** primarily due to hypermetabolism and increased gut motility
- Most patients have hyperphagia; some younger patients may experience weight gain

### Hematologic
- Red blood cell mass is increased; however, greater plasma volume results in **normochromic, normocytic anemia**.

### Genitourinary
- Urinary frequency and nocturia are common
- **Amenorrhea** may occur in severe cases
- In men, **gynecomastia**, reduced libido, and erectile dysfunction may be present

### Neuropsychiatric
- Behavioral changes such as **psychosis**, agitation, and depression
- More common are anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and emotional lability.

### Features Specific to Graves’ Disease
- Ophthalmopathy – inflammation leading to **exophthalmos**
- Thymic enlargement
- **Pretibial myxedema**
- Autoimmune hepatological disorders – immune thrombocytopenia and pernicious anemia

## Investigations

The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is based on thyroid function tests:

- Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
- Serum-free or total T4
- Serum-free or total T3

Here’s a table summarizing the results:

| Condition                       | Serum TSH                   | Serum T4               | Serum T3               |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Overt hyperthyroidism           | Low                        | High                  | High                  |
| T3-toxicosis                   | Low                        | Normal/Low            | High                  |
| T4-toxicosis                   | Low                        | High                  | Normal                |
| Subclinical hyperthyroidism     | Low                        | Normal                | Normal                |
| TSH-induced hyperthyroidism     | Normal/High                | High                  | High                  |

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

### Aetiology
- Can develop in longstanding hyperthyroidism; often precipitated by acute events such as thyroid or nonthyroidal surgery, trauma, infection, or acute iodine load.
- Hypotheses for thyroid storm include rapid increases in serum thyroid hormones or enhanced cellular response to thyroid hormones.

### Diagnosis
- Based on severe and life-threatening symptoms:
  - Common symptoms include tachycardia (`>140 BPM`), hyperpyrexia (`>40` °C), and altered mental state.
  - Potentially includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.

### Treatment
- **Beta-blockers** to control signs induced by increased adrenergic tone
- **Thionamides** to block new hormone synthesis
- **Iodine solution** to block release of thyroid hormone
- **Glucocorticoids** to reduce T4 to T3 conversion
- **ICU escalation** may be necessary

## Management (Prescribing)

Management is primarily focused on normalizing thyroid function parameters. Common options include:

### Antithyroid Drugs
- Used in patients aiming for clinical remission, or those with contraindications to radioiodine therapy or surgery.

**Single Antithyroid Therapy Options:**

- **Carbimazole**
  - Initial: `20-40 mg/day`
  - Maintenance: `5-15 mg/day`
- **Thiamazole** – specialist guidelines required for dosing.

**Block and Replace Regimes:**
- **Carbimazole:** `40-60 mg/day` (titrate according to response) 
- **Levothyroxine:** `100-150 micrograms/day` when patient is euthyroid.

**Symptomatic Therapy:**
- For managing symptoms like tachycardia, tremor, and anxiety:

### Primary Options – Beta-blockers:
- **Propanolol:** `80-160 mg/day` (extended release)
- **Atenolol:** `50-100 mg/day`

### Secondary Options – Calcium Channel Blockers:
- **Diltiazem:** `120-240 mg/day` (extended release)
- **Verapamil:** `120-240 mg/day`

**Orbitopathy Therapy:**
- Mildly active orbitopathy managed with lubricant eye drops.
- Moderate to severe cases require **methylprednisolone** managed by an expert MDT, including ophthalmologist and endocrinologist.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Radioactive Iodine Therapy
- First-line treatment, also used if antithyroid medication or surgery is unsuccessful.

### Surgical Interventions
- Preferential in:
  - Women planning pregnancy within `6 months`
  - Symptomatic compression from large goiters
  - Low uptake of radioactive iodine
  - Suspected thyroid malignancy
  - Large thyroid nodules
  - Moderate to severe Graves’ disease.

### Preoperative Considerations
- Patients must be prepared with antithyroid medications until a euthyroid state is achieved.

### Lifelong Management
- Both radioactive iodine therapy and surgical intervention require lifelong thyroxine replacement post-operation.
