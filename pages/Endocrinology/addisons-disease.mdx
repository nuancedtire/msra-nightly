# Addison's Disease: A Comprehensive Overview

Primary adrenal insufficiency, eponymously named **Addison’s disease**, is a disorder characterized by the **adrenal glands' decreased production** of adrenocortical hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone). **Approximately 90%** of the adrenal cortex must be destroyed for adrenal insufficiency to occur. Addison’s disease can be acute, presenting as an adrenal crisis, or gradual and insidious. If untreated, it poses a **potentially life-threatening** risk.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing Addison’s disease can be challenging due to its **non-specific signs and symptoms**. Many patients are diagnosed only after experiencing a **life-threatening adrenal crisis**.

### Common Associated Symptoms

- **Fatigue**
- **Anorexia**
- **Weight loss**
- **Nausea**
- **Vomiting**

### Common Associated Signs

- **Hyperpigmentation**
  - Typically found in mucosa and sun-exposed areas, especially pronounced in palm creases, areas of friction, and scars.
- **Hypotension**
  - Systolic blood pressure < `110 mmHg`
- **Alopecia**
  - Women may exhibit loss of axillary and pubic hair.

### Common Associated Risk Factors

- **Female sex**: Over 90% of patients with Addison’s disease are female.
- **Adrenocortical autoantibodies**: Positive tests indicate a ~50% risk of developing Addison’s disease.
- **Adrenal hemorrhage**: Associated with anticoagulant use or conditions leading to thromboembolic and hypercoagulable states (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome and sepsis).

## Investigations

The following investigations are appropriate for confirming adrenal insufficiency in non-urgent situations and determining its aetiology.

### 1st Line Investigations

- **Serum electrolytes**: Not diagnostic, but low sodium and high potassium are typical.
- **Blood urea**: Elevated levels may indicate Addison’s disease.
- **Full Blood Count (FBC)**: Anemia in ~40% of patients; eosinophilia may also be observed.
- **Morning Serum Cortisol**:
  - Draw **between 8 am-9 am** (when cortisol levels peak).
  - Levels < `83 nanomols/L` suggest adrenal insufficiency.
  - Levels > `497 nanomols/L` effectively exclude Addison’s disease.
  - Levels 83-497 require further investigation with a high-dose **adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)** stimulation test.

### Investigations to Consider

- **ACTH Stimulation Test**: Follow-up if morning cortisol levels are between `83-497 nanomols/L`.
  - Cortisol levels < `497 nanomols/L` at either 30 or 60 minutes after stimulation suggest adrenal insufficiency.
  - Levels > `497` at these times generally exclude the diagnosis.
- **Serum ACTH Levels**: If ACTH test is consistent with adrenal insufficiency:
  - High ACTH suggests primary adrenal insufficiency.
  - Low ACTH suggests secondary adrenal insufficiency.
- **Plasma Aldosterone**: Necessary if ACTH levels are inconclusive.
  - Low aldosterone supports a diagnosis of Addison’s disease.
- **Adrenal Imaging**: CT or MRI may be required if the underlying cause remains unclear after diagnosis.

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies Related to this Condition

### Addisonian Crisis

#### Aetiology

- Patients with Addison’s disease requiring increased steroids during stress (infection, trauma, surgery) but not receiving them.
- Patients on long-term steroid treatment who have forgotten or are unable to take their medication.

#### Diagnosis

- **Shock presentation**:
  - Symptoms: Increased pulse, vasoconstriction, postural hypotension, oliguria, confusion, or coma.
  - History: Suggestive of Addison’s disease or long-term steroid treatment.

#### Initial Management

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Always treat for crisis before biochemical results are available if Addison's disease is suspected.
</Callout>

- **Blood tests**: Cortisol, ACTH, UEs
  - Raised potassium: ECG necessary, consider calcium gluconate.
  - Low sodium: Should resolve with rehydration and steroids.
- **Hydrocortisone**: Administer `100 mg IV STAT`.
- **IV Fluid Bolus**: To support blood pressure (BP).
- **Monitor blood glucose**: Watch for hypoglycaemia.
- **Cultural Tests**: Blood/urine/sputum culture as appropriate; antibiotics if infection is a concern.

#### Continued Management

- Consider **IV glucose** for hypoglycaemia.
- Provide IV fluids as guided by clinical state to correct UEs.
- Continue hydrocortisone (100 mg IV or IM every 8 hours).
- Switch to oral steroids after `72 hours` if the patient improves.
- Investigate and treat the underlying cause; refer to endocrinology if needed.

## Management (Prescribing)

Replacement therapy aims to **mimic endogenous hormone secretion** and is required as **lifelong therapy**.

### 1st Line

- **Glucocorticoids and Mineralocorticoid**:
  - Options: Cortisone OR hydrocortisone OR prednisolone + Fludrocortisone.
  - Be wary of excessive replacement, which can cause hypertension, hypokalaemia, and edema.
- **Stress Management**: Physiological increases in glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are necessary during times of stress.
  - **Febrile patients**: Double doses while febrile, then weaned over a few days post-resolution.
  - **Minor procedures**: Double or triple doses for three days before resuming normal.
  - **Major trauma/infection/stressful events**: Administer IV hydrocortisone.
  - **Pregnancy**: Increased doses needed; regular monitoring (every `6 to 8 weeks`) with adjustments as necessary.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 54-year-old woman presents to the clinic with severe fatigue, weight loss, and hyperpigmentation of her skin. Laboratory tests reveal low morning serum cortisol levels and high ACTH levels. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Cushing's syndrome",
      "Adrenal crisis",
      "Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)",
      "Secondary adrenal insufficiency",
      "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The combination of low morning serum cortisol levels and high ACTH levels indicates primary adrenal insufficiency, consistent with Addison's disease. This condition often presents with fatigue, weight loss, and hyperpigmentation due to increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) derived from ACTH.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the implications of both cortisol and ACTH levels in this scenario. A high ACTH level suggests that the adrenal glands are not responding appropriately, indicating primary adrenal insufficiency rather than conditions like Cushing's or secondary adrenal insufficiency."
  },
  {
    question: "During a follow-up visit, a 39-year-old woman with known Addison's disease reports feeling increasingly fatigued and has not been adhering to her medication regimen during stressful periods. What is the immediate management step you should take considering the risk of an adrenal crisis?",
    options: [
      "Increase the dose of fludrocortisone",
      "Schedule for an ACTH stimulation test",
      "Administer intravenous hydrocortisone",
      "Reassess serum electrolytes",
      "Provide patient counseling on medication adherence"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In a patient with known Addison's disease who has not taken her medications during stress, you should administer intravenous hydrocortisone immediately to prevent or treat an adrenal crisis, as this can be life-threatening.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the urgency of the situation. In potential adrenal crises, intravenous hydrocortisone is critical for immediate stabilization. Other options are important but not the priority in this emergency context."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with suspected adrenal crisis exhibits symptoms of low sodium and high potassium. Which of the following findings on an ECG would likely indicate hyperkalemia associated with this disorder?",
    options: [
      "ST-segment elevation",
      "T-wave inversion",
      "Widened QRS complex",
      "Bradycardia",
      "Shortened QT interval"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A widened QRS complex on an ECG is characteristic of hyperkalemia, which can be associated with adrenal crisis due to the adrenal glands' inability to produce sufficient aldosterone.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the relationship between hyperkalemia and cardiac conduction. Various ECG changes can arise from electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium levels. What specific ECG change correlates with elevated potassium?"
  },
  {
    question: "In a patient with evidence of adrenal insufficiency, which of the following laboratory findings would most likely be expected?",
    options: [
      "Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia",
      "Hypernatremia and hypokalemia",
      "Normal sodium and elevated potassium",
      "Elevated sodium and normal potassium",
      "Hypoglycemia and high urea"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In Addison's disease, adrenal insufficiency leads to low aldosterone levels, resulting in hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (high potassium). This is a classic hallmark of the condition.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the hormone imbalances that occur in adrenal insufficiency. Understand the roles of cortisol and aldosterone in maintaining electrolyte balance, particularly sodium and potassium levels."
