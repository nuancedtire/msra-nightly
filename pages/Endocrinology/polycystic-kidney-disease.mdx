# Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is part of a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by renal cysts and various systemic and extrarenal manifestations. There are two main types of PKD: **autosomal recessive (ARPKD)** and **autosomal dominant (ADPKD)**. ADPKD is the more common form and will be the focus of this article.

## Diagnosis

### Common Presenting Symptoms

- **Hypertension**
  - Affects nearly all patients
  - Often presents before any renal function abnormalities
  - In patients aged 20 to 34 years, can often be detected before other clinical manifestations

- **Abdominal/Flank Pain**
  - Often caused by nephrolithiasis, infection, hemorrhage, or urinary tract infections

- **Hematuria**
  - Both macro and microscopic

- **Dysuria, Urgency, Suprapubic Pain, Fever**
  - 50-70% of all patients may experience at least one clinical urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime

### Strong Risk Factors

- Family history of **ADPKD** or **end-stage renal disease (ESRD)**
- Family history of a cerebrovascular event

### Common Examination Findings

- **Palpable Kidneys/Abdominal Mass**
  - Abdominal examination often reveals a palpable renal or hepatic mass
- **Cardiac Murmur**
  - Common cardiac abnormalities include mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and dilated aortic root
- **Hernias**
- **Hepatomegaly**
  - Polycystic liver disease is typically asymptomatic
  - Frequency increases with age

## Investigations

### 1st Line Investigations

| Investigation Type                     | Criteria                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Renal Ultrasound**                  | Age dependent:<br/>- `<30` years: at least 2 unilateral or bilateral cysts<br/>- `30-59` years: 2 cysts in each kidney<br/>- `>60` years: 4 cysts in each kidney |
| **CT Scan of Abdomen/Pelvis**         | Considered if ultrasound is ambiguous, age and family history dependent:<br/>- Absence of FHx: `>10` cysts in each kidney<br/>- Presence of FHx:<br/>- `<30` years: at least 2 unilateral or bilateral cysts<br/>- `30-59` years: 2 cysts in each kidney<br/>- `>60` years: 4 cysts in each kidney |
| **MRI Abdomen/Pelvis**                | Considered if ultrasound is ambiguous, criteria: `>10` cysts in each kidney |
| **Urinalysis/Gram Stain and Culture** | Always obtained when symptoms indicate UTI; assists in assessing likelihood of disease progression to chronic kidney disease |
| **Serum Electrolytes, Urea, & Creatinine** | Normal or elevated results                                          |
| **Fasting Lipid Levels**               | Prognostic marker; normal or elevated                             |
| **ECG**                                | Requested in patients with cardiac murmurs or suspected left ventricular dysfunction |

### Investigations to Consider

- **Genetic Testing** for PKD1 or PKD2 mutations
- **KUB X-ray and Tomogram**: Evaluation of stone disease and renal calcification, either as baseline or if symptomatic

**Note:** Urinalysis should be ordered in all patients to detect increased urinary albumin.

## Management (Prescribing)

The primary goals of treatment are to prolong life, delay the onset of renal failure, and manage complications.

### Hypertension Management

- **1st Line**: 
  - Captopril, Enalapril, Perindopril, Ramipril, Benazepril, Losartan, Candesartan, Valsartan, Ibesartan, Telmisartan, Olmesartan
- **2nd Line**: 
  - Labetalol, Carvedilol
- **3rd Line**: 
  - Metoprolol, Nebivolol, Hydrochlorothiazide, Furosemide

### Urinary Tract Infections Management

- **1st Line**: 
  - Antibiotic therapy according to cultures and local guidelines

### Infected Renal Cyst Management

- **1st Line**: 
  - Primary: Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin
  - Secondary: Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole
  - Tertiary: Chloramphenicol

### Renal Pain Management

- **1st Line**: 
  - Investigation and treatment of the underlying cause
- **Adjunct**: 
  - Supportive care, bed rest, avoidance of long-term nephrotoxic drugs
- **2nd Line**: 
  - Analgesia if no reversible cause found

### Nephrolithiasis Management

- **1st Line**: 
  - Analgesia

### Polycystic Liver Disease Management

- **Asymptomatic**: 
  - Observation; avoid drugs that lead to cAMP accumulation (e.g., caffeine)
- **Symptomatic**: 
  - Infected cysts managed with antibiotic therapy:
    - Primary: Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin or Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole
    - Secondary: Doxycycline

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Hypertension Management

- **1st Line Adjunct**: 
  - Lifestyle modifications: dietary salt restrictions, exercise, and maintaining healthy body weight

### Infected Renal Cyst Management

- **1st Line Adjunct**: 
  - Cyst drainage: Percutaneous or surgical drainage if no prompt antibiotic response or if fever (`>38.5°C`) persists for three days, alongside abdominal pain and elevated CRP (`>50`).
- **2nd Line**: 
  - Nephrectomy if infections are recurrent or persistent

### Renal Pain Management

- **3rd Line**: 
  - Surgical interventions: Cyst aspirating under CT guidance; sclerosing drugs may be used for fluid management.
- **4th Line**: 
  - Nephrectomy in rare cases of end-stage renal disease when preparing for a transplant

### Nephrolithiasis Management

- **2nd Line**: 
  - Surgery options: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, retrograde endoscopy, or manipulation

### Polycystic Liver Disease Management

- **Symptomatic Non-infected Cysts**: 
  - Surgical intervention to reduce cyst volume and liver size, depending on anatomy and cyst distribution

### End-Stage Renal Disease Management

- **1st Line**: 
  - Renal transplant; living donor transplantation preferred
- **2nd Line**: 
  - Dialysis; hemodialysis preferred over peritoneal dialysis due to the risk of inadequate dialysis volume instillation and increased hernia and peritonitis risks.

    question: "A 45-year-old male with a family history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) presents for evaluation. He has been experiencing intermittent flank pain and occasional hematuria. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial imaging study to evaluate for renal cysts?",
    options: [
      "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen",
      "CT Scan of the abdomen/pelvis",
      "Renal Ultrasound",
      "KUB X-ray",
      "Urinalysis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Renal ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality for evaluating renal cysts in suspected ADPKD, particularly in younger patients. However, in this scenario, since the patient’s age falls within the risk range and symptoms are present, it would still be appropriate to evaluate with a renal ultrasound first. A CT scan is generally reserved for cases where ultrasound findings are ambiguous.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the initial investigation recommendations for patients with suspected ADPKD. What imaging technique is often utilized for its ability to non-invasively visualize renal structure without radiation, and how does the patient's age factor into the decision-making?"
