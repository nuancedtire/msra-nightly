# Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT)

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an **endocrine condition** characterized by the autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PHT), leading to a deranged metabolism of calcium. The most common cause (80%) of excessive PHT production is a single parathyroid adenoma; multi-gland involvement may occur less frequently. It's important to note that **hyperparathyroidism is rarely caused by parathyroid cancer**, which is associated with severe hypercalcaemia.

## Diagnosis

The detection of PHPT usually occurs incidentally during routine laboratory investigations in Europe and the US; however, rare cases may be diagnosed clinically, followed by laboratory confirmation. In most resource-poor countries, patients present with symptomatic conditions.

### Common Symptoms

The most prevalent symptoms include:

- **Fatigue**
- **Poor sleep**
- **Myalgia**
- **Anxiety**
- **Depression**
- **Memory loss**
- **Bone pain**
- **Constipation**
- **Muscle cramps**
- **Paresthesia**

### Uncommon Symptoms

Less common associated symptoms include:

- **Overt neuromuscular dysfunction**
- **Abdominal pain** 
- **Cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction**

### Medical History

Relevant medical history associations include:

- **Osteoporosis**
- **Osteopenia**
- **Nephrolithiasis**
- **Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 1, 2A, or 4**
- **Hyperthyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome**
- **Family history** of HPT or features suggested of hypercalcaemia

### Risk Factors

Risk factors with a strong association include:

- **Female sex**: 2 to 3 times more common
- **Age `>50` years**
- **Current or historical lithium treatment**

Physical examination is usually unremarkable; however, a hard, dense neck mass may indicate the presence of parathyroid carcinoma.

## Investigations

Diagnosis of PHPT requires elevated serum calcium, inappropriately unsuppressed serum intact PTH levels, and normal/raised urinary calcium with normal renal function.

### 1st Line Investigations

- **Serum calcium**: Elevated levels suggest PHPT, **high-normal levels** with high clinical suspicion should be rechecked on a separate day after fasting.
- **Serum intact PTH**: Elevated levels in the presence of elevated calcium levels confirm the diagnosis of PHPT.

### Additional Investigations

- **24-hour urinary calcium**: Used in patients with presumed HPT, differentiates between PHPT and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia through renal calcium to creatinine ratio.
- **25-hydroxyvitamin D level**: Vitamin D deficiency may co-exist with PHPT; low levels can artificially elevate PHT levels in patients without PHPT.
- **Serum alkaline phosphate**: Elevated levels indicate high bone turnover disease and possible post-parathyroidectomy hypocalcaemia.
- **Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan**: Should be performed to assess disease progression in PHPT patients.

## Management

### Prescribing

All patients with concurrent vitamin D deficiency should be offered supplementation. Primary options include:

- **Ergocalciferol**
- **Colecalciferol**

If osteoporosis is present, patients should consider bisphosphonates, including:

- **Alendronic acid**
- **Risedronate sodium**
- **Ibandronic acid**
- **Zoledronic acid**

Cinacalcet may be appropriate for some patients, particularly those who decline surgery or are not candidates for surgery.

### Non-Prescribing

**Parathyroid surgery** is the definitive treatment for PHPT. Consensus exists that parathyroidectomy is indicated for symptomatic HPT, where "symptomatic" denotes known target end-organ complications, such as:

- **Bone disease/fractures**
- **Renal stones**
- **Overt neuromuscular dysfunction**

Asymptomatic patients can still benefit from surgical intervention for improved quality of life. Common indications for surgery in asymptomatic patients include:

- Age ` <50` years
- Inability to ensure appropriate follow-up
- Serum calcium `>0.25mmol/L`
- Creatinine clearance `<60 mL/minute`
- Bone mineral density T-score `< -2.5` at the lumbar spine, hip, or radius, and/or vertebral fracture
- 24-hour urinary calcium `>400` mg/day with increased stone risk
- Presence of nephrolithiasis

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 58-year-old female is diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism after presenting with fatigue and bone pain. Laboratory results reveal elevated serum calcium and elevated intact PTH levels. Which of the following symptoms is least likely to be associated with her condition?",
    options: [
      "Constipation",
      "Muscle cramps",
      "Hyperactivity",
      "Paresthesia"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Hyperactivity is not commonly associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, whereas constipation, muscle cramps, and paresthesia are prevalent symptoms related to this condition, due to alterations in calcium metabolism.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the classic symptoms related to elevated calcium levels. Conditions associated with high calcium can lead to effects on the neuromuscular system. Review the common symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism."
  },
  {
    question: "During the evaluation of a patient with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism, which investigative finding will help distinguish primary hyperparathyroidism from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia?",
    options: [
      "Elevated serum phosphate levels",
      "Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels",
      "Inappropriately suppressed serum intact PTH levels",
      "24-hour urinary calcium excretion"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The 24-hour urinary calcium excretion is a key differentiator; patients with primary hyperparathyroidism typically have high urinary calcium, whereas those with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia have low urinary calcium despite hypercalcemia.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider how hyperparathyroidism affects calcium handling in the kidneys. What does the urinary calcium level tell you about calcium metabolism? Revisit the differences in calcium metabolism between these two conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old male with a history of primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with conservative therapy, including bisphosphonates. His serum calcium level remains elevated. Which of the following is the definitive treatment for his condition?",
    options: [
      "Calcitriol therapy",
      "Parathyroidectomy",
      "Cinacalcet",
      "Increased hydration"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism, especially when there are symptoms or complications associated with the condition. Bisphosphonates may help manage bone complications but do not address the underlying cause.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While various medical therapies can help manage symptoms or control calcium levels, consider what resolves the underlying issue in primary hyperparathyroidism. What surgical option exists for definitive management?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 52-year-old woman with primary hyperparathyroidism presents for follow-up. She reports no current symptoms but has a family history of parathyroid cancer. Which of the following conditions would likely indicate a need for surgical intervention?",
    options: [
      "Serum calcium level of 10.8 mg/dL",
      "Age under 50 years",
      "T-score of -1.8",
      "24-hour urinary calcium of 350 mg"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Age under 50 years is one of the established indications for surgical intervention in asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism, due to increased risk of complications with age. The other options do not meet the established surgical criteria.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the indications for surgery in asymptomatic patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. What particular factors would lead to a recommendation for surgical intervention, despite the absence of current symptoms?"
