# Lichen Planus: Overview and Management

Lichen planus is a common inflammatory skin condition with an unknown aetiology. It affects individuals across all ages but is primarily observed between **ages 40 and 60**. The distinctive characteristics of lichen planus can be remembered through the **'5 Ps'**:

- **Purple**
- **Polygonal**
- **Papular**
- **Pruritic**
- **Planar** (flat-topped)

## Key Features

### Wickham’s Striae

Wickham’s striae refers to striated white markings that may overlay the papules and is considered a **pathognomonic feature** of the disease. 

### Types of Lichen Planus

The condition can manifest in various forms:

- **Cutaneous Lichen Planus**
  - Typically affects:
    - Wrists
    - Forearms
    - Lower legs
    - Ankles

- **Mucosal Lichen Planus**
  - Generally involves:
    - Oral mucosa
    - Genitals

## Disease Course

- **Chronic** and **relapsing-remitting** in nature.
- No cure currently exists for lichen planus.
- Lesions can persist for `12 to 18 months` even after treatment.

## Treatment Options

Lesions can be managed through various treatment strategies, including:

1. **Topical Corticosteroids**
   - Help to hasten remission of the lesions.
