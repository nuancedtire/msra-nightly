# Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS)

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an **autosomal dominant disorder** characterized by the growth of benign hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and distinctive mucocutaneous pigmentation. It is caused by mutations in the **STK11** tumor suppressor gene. Without a properly functioning gene, GI cells accumulate mutations and divide more rapidly than normal, leading to polyp formation. Polyps can result in obstruction, ulcerate, and cause GI bleeding. The presence of numerous polyps throughout the GI tract significantly increases the risk of bowel cancer, and the syndrome is associated with extra-intestinal cancers, particularly carcinoma of the pancreas, breast, ovaries, and testicles. The estimated lifetime risk for developing cancer is approximately **93%**.

## Diagnosis

PJS often presents with no symptoms; however, small bowel obstruction is the most common initial feature, occurring in nearly **50%** of patients. Notably:

- Over **80%** of patients with PJS develop polyps.
- Around **50%** require surgical intervention for bowel obstruction before age **20**.
- Symptoms typically arise between **10** and **30** years of age.

### Other Presenting Features:
- **Abdominal pain**
- **Haematochezia**
- **Intussusception**
- **Anaemia**
- **Prolapse of anal polyps**

*Anaemia, due to GI bleeding from polyps, is uncommon but may contribute to non-specific presenting symptoms, such as fatigue and pallor.*

The characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation appears in the following regions and is present in **95%** of patients:

- Buccal mucosa
- Lips
- Peri-oral region
- Fingers
- Genitals

*These pigmentations do not undergo malignant transformation and may fade during puberty, except for buccal lesions, which typically persist.*

### WHO Diagnosis Criteria
According to the WHO, a diagnosis of PJS can be established if a patient meets one of these criteria:

- **Three or more confirmed polyps**
- **Any number of polyps with a family history of PJS**
- **Mucocutaneous pigmentation with a family history of PJS**
- **Any number of polyps and characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation**

## Investigations

If PJS is suspected, the first-line investigation is **endoscopy**, including OGD, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy. Polyps often develop during the first decade of life:

- On endoscopy, **88%** of patients will be found to have polyps.
- **Small intestinal polyposis** is seen in over **75%** of patients, but polyps can occur throughout the large intestine and stomach as well.
- Typically, multiple polyps are visualized on endoscopy in PJS patients, though the total number often stays under **20**.

### Biopsy and Genetic Testing
Polyps are biopsied during endoscopy and reviewed histologically to aid diagnosis. Additionally, genetic testing can be conducted:

- **Germline genetic testing** confirms PJS diagnosis in patients meeting the WHO criteria.
- A positive result indicates an **STK11 mutation**, which can be determined through gene sequencing to identify duplications or deletions.
  
*Even if genetic testing is negative, the patient can still be managed as though having PJS and undergo further genetic evaluation for other causes.*

## Management (Prescribing)

Currently, there is no **pharmacological prophylaxis** available for reducing polyps in PJS that is routinely used in clinical practice. Research is ongoing, and several agents are being evaluated through clinical trials.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Management of PJS requires **routine surveillance**, prevention of complications, and treatment of complications.

### Screening Recommendations

From age **10**, patients require regular screening due to increased cancer risks:

- **Upper GI Endoscopy and Colonoscopy**
  - Starts at **12 years** old
  - If polyps are present: repeat **annually**
  - If no polyps: repeat **every 2-3 years** for endoscopy and **1-3 years** for colonoscopy
- **Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)** or ultrasound
  - Starts at **25 years**, repeated every **1-2 years**
- **Breast Monitoring:**
  - Self-breast examination begins at **18 years**
  - **Annual MRI** at age **25**, transitioning to mammography at **50 years**
- **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** yearly starting at **25 years**, with smear tests every **2-3 years**
- **Testicular Examination:** annual examinations starting at **12 years**, with appropriate ultrasound follow-up

### Prevention Strategies

- If large polyps are evident or a patient is symptomatic, **removal** is indicated, typically via endoscopy or balloon enteroscopy.
- **Colectomy** may be considered for patients with rapid progression of polyp size/number, multiple polyps over **10mm**, or numerous polyps with high-grade dysplasia to minimize complications, including obstruction, bleeding, or cancer.

### Mucocutaneous Pigmentation Management

If the cosmetic appearance of mucocutaneous pigmentation is significant or causes psychological distress, treatment options include:

- **Laser therapy**
- **Light source therapy**

  {
    question: "A 15-year-old boy presents with abdominal pain and has a family history of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. During an endoscopy, multiple hamartomatous polyps are discovered in the small intestine. Which of the following findings would most likely support the diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome?",
    options: [
      "Presence of colorectal adenomas",
      "Buccal mucosa pigmentation",
      "Presence of familial adenomatous polyposis",
      "Single juvenile polyp",
      "Presence of lipomas"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Buccal mucosa pigmentation is a key feature of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and its presence alongside hamartomatous polyps strongly supports the diagnosis. In this case, both factors align with the WHO diagnostic criteria for PJS.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the specific mucocutaneous manifestations associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Think about how pigmentation in the mucosal regions can serve as a diagnostic criterion for this condition."
  },
  {
