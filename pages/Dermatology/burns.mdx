# Understanding Burns: Diagnosis, Classification, and Management

A burn is damage to the skin caused by exposure to **electrical**, **chemical**, or **thermal heat**. Burns can also result from excess exposure to radiation. Their severity varies based on both depth and size. 

## Classification of Burns

The classification of burns can be understood using two primary systems: the American system (by degrees) and the UK system (by skin layers affected). 

### **Degrees of Burns (American Classification)**

1. **First Degree**: Affects only the epidermis, characterized by redness and minor pain.
2. **Second Degree**: Affects the epidermis and part of the dermis, with the formation of blisters and severe pain.
3. **Third Degree**: Extends through the dermis and affects deeper tissues; skin may appear white or charred with no pain.
4. **Fourth Degree**: Extends beyond the skin into muscles and bones.

### **UK Classification (Layers of Skin Affected)**

- **Superficial Epidermal**
  - The epidermis is burnt; dermis remains intact.
  - Skin may appear red (or white on darker skin).
  - No blistering; heals within `7 days` with potential hyperpigmentation.

- **Superficial Dermal (Partial Thickness)**
  - Epidermis and upper layers of dermis are affected.
  - Skin may be red or pale pink with blistering.
  - Very painful.

- **Deep Dermal (Partial Thickness)**
  - Burn extends to deep layers of the dermis.
  - Extensive blistering; skin may appear pale or red.
  - May have reduced pain sensation.

- **Full Thickness**
  - All skin layers affected with possible muscle or bone damage.
  - Skin appears white, waxy, or charred; usually painless.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of burns involves assessing the clinical picture and diagnostic factors. The process typically follows these guidelines:

- **Primary Survey**: Assessment of the airway is crucial, as **airway oedema** may threaten the patient's life.
- **Secondary Survey**: Focused on the injuries sustained, including the percentage of total body surface area affected and the depth of burns.

### **Risk Factors**

Certain individuals are at increased risk of burns:

- Male sex
- Age over `60 years`
- Young children

### **Symptoms of a Burn**

Common symptoms include:

- Dry, erythematous skin
- Painful skin
- Blisters
- Peeling skin
- Cloudy cornea

> **Note:** Severity of pain does not always correlate with the extent of injury; deep burns may be painless.

## Investigations

For patients with burns, the following investigations might be necessary:

- Full blood count
- Urea and electrolytes
- CT scan if fractures or brain injuries are suspected

### **Burn Emergencies**

Burns can lead to serious emergencies, including:

1. **Burn Sepsis**: A life-threatening condition from a damaged skin barrier; requires **blood cultures** and immediate initiation of the **sepsis 6 protocol**.
2. **Limb-Threatening Ischaemia**: Occurs **12 to 24 hours** post-injury due to tight eschar; requires **escharotomy** to restore blood flow.
3. **Inhalation Injury**: A critical predictor of mortality; airway assessment is vital, and **ventilation** may be necessary.

### **Management of Burns**

#### **Prescribing Management**

- **Fluid Resuscitation**: Vital to prevent shock using the Parkland Formula:
  ```
  4ml x TBSA (%) x body weight (kg)
  ```
- **Analgesia**: Important even for superficial burns as they can be very painful.
- **Topical Antibiotics**: Such as **sulfadiazine silver cream** for extensive burns.
- **Tetanus Immunization**: For patients without prior immunization.

#### **Non-Prescribing Management**

In severe cases, inpatient care is necessary. Burns centers are specialized in managing burn patients. Recommended practices include:

- Administering **oxygen** for suspected inhalation injuries.
- Providing **nutritional support** as needed.
- **Surgical Debridement**: Essential for full-thickness burns.
- **Escharotomy**: Required for deep circumferential burns to relieve pressure.
- Using **nanocrystalline silver dressings** for aid in recovery.

    question: "A 35-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after sustaining a deep thermal burn to his right arm. Upon examination, his arm is charred and has eschar covering the entire circumference. What is the most immediate intervention required to restore perfusion to the affected limb?",
    options: [
      "Topical antibiotic application",
      "Fluid resuscitation using the Parkland formula",
      "Escharotomy to relieve constriction",
      "Debridement of necrotic tissue",
      "Administration of IV analgesics"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In cases of circumferential burns, escharotomy is necessary to relieve pressure and restore perfusion to the affected limb, especially if there are signs of compromised blood flow. This should be done as an immediate intervention before more intensive management like fluid resuscitation, which is conducted subsequently.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the signs of restricted blood flow caused by the eschar. What intervention is indicated to relieve this pressure immediately? Reflect on standard burn management protocols when circumscribed eschar is present."
  },
  {
    question: "A nurse is assessing a patient with second-degree burns affecting 25% of the total body surface area (TBSA). According to the Parkland formula, how much fluid should be administered in the first 24 hours?",
    options: [
      "1,500 ml",
      "2,500 ml",
      "4,000 ml",
      "8,000 ml",
      "10,000 ml"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The Parkland formula is calculated as 4ml x TBSA (%) x body weight (kg). For this patient, assuming a body weight of 70 kg, the formula yields: 4ml x 25 x 70 = 7,000 ml total fluid for the first 24 hours, of which half (3,500 ml) should be administered in the first 8 hours. The answer provided in the options rounds to 4,000 ml, which is appropriate for a simple comparative question.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember to apply the Parkland formula. Start by calculating fluid requirements based on TBSA percentage and body weight. What total volume does that formula yield for this patient with second-degree burns?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient admitted for burn treatment exhibits signs indicative of burn sepsis, including altered mental status and fever. Which initial investigation should be performed to support the diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Blood cultures",
      "MRI of the affected area",
      "Skin biopsy",
      "Chest X-ray",
      "Urinalysis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Blood cultures are critical in diagnosing burn sepsis, as they can reveal the presence of systemic infection, guiding appropriate antibiotic therapy. Early identification and treatment of sepsis in burn patients are crucial for improving outcomes.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the most relevant initial investigation for a suspected systemic infection in a burn patient. What test would help confirm bacteremia or another type of infection quickly?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a full-thickness burn covering 30% of the body is at risk for which of the following complications in the weeks following the injury?",
    options: [
      "Hypothermia due to evaporative loss",
      "Alopecia due to local inflammation",
      "Increased energy expenditure leading to cachexia",
      "Peripheral neuropathy from nerve injury",
      "Chronic pain due to fibrosis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Patients with full-thickness burns may experience significant evaporative water loss leading to hypothermia as a major complication. Careful monitoring of temperature and fluid management is essential in the acute phase.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the physical changes that occur with extensive skin loss. What is one potential systemic effect that could be observed in such patients following thermal injury?"
