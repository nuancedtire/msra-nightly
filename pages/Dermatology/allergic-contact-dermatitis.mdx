# Contact Dermatitis

Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease triggered by an irritant (80%, irritant contact dermatitis) or allergen (20%, allergic contact dermatitis). **Allergic contact dermatitis** can be caused by a variety of different allergens, with re-exposure after initial sensitisation causing a delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction. **Prognosis** and **management** depend on whether the allergen(s) are identifiable and avoidable.

## Diagnosis

The acute skin lesions associated with allergic contact dermatitis develop `2 to 3 days` after re-exposure to an allergen. The areas which contacted the allergen are:

- **Itchy**
- **Erythematous**
- **Weepy** due to vesiculation

Chronic or intermittent re-exposure can result in **dry**, **fissured**, or **lichenified skin**.

Allergic contact dermatitis can usually be diagnosed from the **history** and **examination**. The location of contact dermatitis is typically associated with different allergens; for example, ingredients found in cosmetic and hair dye are the usual suspects for face and scalp contact dermatitis.

When there is doubt about the diagnosis or the potential allergen, **further investigation** is warranted.

## Investigations

Patch testing is used to identify the allergen(s) causing the contact dermatitis. It is particularly useful in differentiating allergic dermatitis from irritant dermatitis.

Skin swabs or biopsies may be indicated if there is doubt about the diagnosis or concern about **concurrent infection**.

## Management (non-prescribing)

Contact dermatitis is a **self-limiting** problem that resolves days to weeks after complete avoidance of the identified allergen or irritant. Where it is impossible to avoid the stimulus, advice on how to minimize exposure should be offered.

Other general measures include:

- Using **emollients** liberally
- Using **soap substitutes**

## Management (prescribing)

Topical steroids may be offered for **symptom control** according to the steroid ladder.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman presents with erythematous, itchy rashes on her face and hands. She mentions these symptoms began two days after starting a new facial moisturizer. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for her condition?",
    options: [
      "Type I hypersensitivity reaction",
      "Type II hypersensitivity reaction",
      "Type III hypersensitivity reaction",
      "Type IV hypersensitivity reaction",
      "Irritant contact dermatitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's symptoms of itchy, erythematous rashes occurring 2 days after exposure indicate a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which is delayed and typically associated with allergic contact dermatitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the timing and nature of this reaction. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, such as those seen in allergic contact dermatitis, typically present days after exposure, contrasting with immediate hypersensitivity reactions."
  },
  {
    question: "A patch test is performed on a patient suspected of having allergic contact dermatitis. Which of the following describes the diagnostic significance of the patch test?",
    options: [
      "It confirms the diagnosis of irritant contact dermatitis",
      "It identifies allergic reactions caused by systemic exposure",
      "It determines the chronicity of the dermatitis",
      "It identifies the specific allergens causing the dermatitis",
      "It rules out concurrent infections"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Patch testing is specifically designed to identify the allergens causing allergic contact dermatitis, which is essential for proper management and avoidance strategies.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider what the primary purpose of a patch test is in the context of contact dermatitis. It focuses on identifying specific allergens rather than confirming irritant reactions or assessing chronicity."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is the first-line treatment for a patient with mild allergic contact dermatitis?",
    options: [
      "Oral corticosteroids",
      "Intralesional corticosteroids",
      "Topical corticosteroids",
      "Antibiotics",
      "Emollients"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for managing symptoms and reducing inflammation in mild cases of allergic contact dermatitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the hierarchy of treatment options. In cases of mild allergic contact dermatitis, topical treatments are typically preferred. What would be a common first step in managing localized inflammatory skin conditions?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient is advised to use emollients and soap substitutes to manage their contact dermatitis. What is the primary purpose of these recommendations?",
    options: [
      "To reduce inflammation",
      "To alleviate itching",
      "To moisturize and protect the skin barrier",
      "To treat underlying infections",
      "To facilitate the healing of weepy lesions"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Emollients and soap substitutes are primarily recommended to moisturize the skin and protect the skin barrier, which is crucial in managing dermatitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the role of emollients in skincare. They primarily serve to hydrate and protect the skin rather than directly treat inflammation or infection."
