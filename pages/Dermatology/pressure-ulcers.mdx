# Pressure Ulcers: Overview, Diagnosis, and Management

Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, bedsores, or decubitus ulcers) are damage to the skin and underlying tissue mainly caused by constant pressure, friction, and moisture on certain areas of the body. Constant pressure exerted on the same area of the skin prevents blood from flowing normally, leading to ischaemia. As a result, localized cell death and skin breakdown occur.

## Risk Factors

Pressure ulcers can happen to anyone, but individuals with the following conditions are predisposed to their development:

- **Inability to move parts of the body** due to illness, paralysis, or advanced age
- **Bedridden** or confined to a chair/wheelchair for extended periods
- **Malnourishment** and dehydration
- **Weight loss**, which may leave less padding over bony prominences
- **Sliding down** in a chair or bed causing shearing
- **Friction** or rubbing of the skin (e.g., against bedsheets)
- **Moist skin** due to sweating or incontinence
- Other **comorbidities**, including diabetes
- **Previous history** of pressure ulcers

## Diagnosis

Pressure ulcers typically form over bony prominences, including the heel, sacrum, elbows, and hips. They often develop gradually but can sometimes form in `<12 hours`.

### Stages of Presentation and Pressure Ulcers Grading

According to the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP), pressure ulcers are classified into four grades of severity:

1. **Grade 1**: 
   - **Pain and/or itchiness** over the affected skin area
   - Discoloration (red patches in paler skin; purple or blue patches in darker skin)
   - Non-blanching erythema (discolored patches do not turn white when pressed)
   - Skin feels **warm, spongy, or hard**

2. **Grade 2**:
   - Partial-thickness skin loss affecting the epidermis and/or dermis
   - Skin injury resembles an **abrasion or blister**

3. **Grade 3**:
   - **Full thickness skin loss**, reaching subcutaneous tissue
   - Injury does not extend into the underlying fascia

4. **Grade 4**:
   - Extensive destruction with skin loss, involving **underlying muscle, bone, or supporting structures**

### Complications

Be aware of signs of serious infection such as:

- **Red and swollen skin**
- **Pus** discharging from the wound
- Cold skin with a **fast heartbeat**
- Severe or **worsening pain**
- **High temperature**

## Investigations

Clinicians widely use the Waterlow score to assess patients at risk of developing pressure ulcers. This score predicts a patient's risk based on several factors:

- Gender
- Age group
- Body mass index
- Skin type
- Mobility
- Continence
- Recent weight loss
- Nutritional status
- Comorbidities
- Medications

*It is recommended to perform this assessment within 4 hours of admission, and the results should be recorded and monitored. The Waterlow score should be used as an adjunct in making a clinical diagnosis.*

| Waterlow Score     | Risk Level                               |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ≤ 9                | Patient is at little to no risk         |
| 10 – 14            | Patient is at risk                       |
| 15 – 19            | Patient is at high risk                 |
| ≥ 20               | Patient is at very high risk            |

Wound swabs should not be done routinely, as most pressure ulcers are colonized with bacteria.

## Management (Prescribing)

### Topical Treatment

Topical antiseptics or antibiotic creams are generally **not recommended** for treating pressure ulcers. However, barrier creams may be required to protect skin damaged or irritated by incontinence.

### Antibiotics

Systemic antibiotics should only be prescribed to treat **infected pressure ulcers** or serious infections, including sepsis, cellulitis, and osteomyelitis.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Preventing Pressure Ulcers

- **Regular repositioning**
- Use of **pressure-relieving devices** (e.g., special beds)
- Daily monitoring of patient’s skin for early signs of pressure ulcers
- **Healthy and balanced diet** containing adequate protein, vitamins, and minerals
- **Smoking cessation** – Smoking can damage blood circulation, increasing the likelihood of pressure ulcers

### Ways to Stop Pressure Ulcers from Getting Worse and Promote Healing

- Apply **alginate** or **hydrocolloid dressings** to promote healing and relieve pressure
- **Avoid gauze dressings** for prevention or treatment
- Avoid using soap as it can dry up the wound
- Mobilize and regularly reposition the patient
- Use specially designed **static foam** or **dynamic mattresses/cushions**
- Maintain a **healthy diet** and avoid dehydration

### Debridement

Debridement (removing damaged tissue) may be necessary to promote healing. 

- Small amounts of dead tissue can be removed using specially designed dressings.
- Larger amounts may require high-pressure water jets, ultrasound, and surgical instruments, usually with local anesthesia for pain control.

### Surgery

Surgery may be required for severe pressure ulcers that cannot heal on their own. Surgical treatment involves cleaning the wound and sealing it by bringing the edges together or using tissue from healthy skin to close the ulcer.

> **Warning:** Post-operative risks include dying of the implanted skin tissue, osteomyelitis, abscesses, deep vein thrombosis, and sepsis. The risks and benefits of surgery should be weighed before proceeding.

  {
    question: "A 75-year-old bedridden male patient is assessed for pressure ulcer risk upon admission to the hospital. He has a Waterlow score of 18. What does this score indicate about his risk for developing pressure ulcers?",

      "He is at little to no risk of developing pressure ulcers.",
      "He is at risk for developing pressure ulcers.",
      "He is at high risk for developing pressure ulcers.",
