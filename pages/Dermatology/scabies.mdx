# Scabies: Overview, Diagnosis, and Management

Scabies is a contagious skin disease marked by a very itchy rash. It is caused by the parasitic mite _Sarcoptes scabiei_ burrowing into the skin surface and laying its eggs in the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the skin). Scabies is usually spread by skin-to-skin contact, such as holding hands with someone who has contracted scabies. Occasionally, it can be sexually transmitted or acquired from furnishings or bedding.

## Diagnosis

### Common Features

- **Linear burrows** (may be tortuous) or rubbery nodules
- Widespread **pruritus** (worse at night, and may persist for up to `4-6 weeks` post-eradication)
- Commonly affected sites:
  - Finger webs
  - Side of fingers
  - Flexor aspects of the wrist
  - Elbows
  - Ankles
  - Feet
  - Nipples and genitals
- The face and scalp may be affected in infants

### Risk Factors

- Poverty and overcrowding
- Refugee camps
- Institutional care (e.g., rest homes, hospitals, prisons)
- Immunodeficient or immunosuppressed individuals 

### Diagnostic Criteria

Published by the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (IACS) in 2018:

- **A: Confirmed Scabies**
  - **A1**: Mites, eggs, or faeces on light microscopy of a skin sample
  - **A2**: Mites, eggs, or faeces visualized on an individual using a high-powered imaging device
  - **A3**: Mites visualized on an individual using dermatoscopy
- **B: Clinical Scabies**
  - **B1**: Scabies burrows
  - **B2**: Typical lesions affecting male genitalia
  - **B3**: Typical lesions in a typical distribution and two history features
- **C: Suspected Scabies**
  - **C1**: Typical lesions in a typical distribution and one history feature
  - **C2**: Atypical lesions or atypical distribution and two history features

#### History Features

- **H1**: Itch
- **H2**: Close contact with an individual who has an itch or typical lesions in a typical distribution

**Note:** These criteria should be used in conjunction with the full explanatory notes and definitions (in preparation by IACS). A diagnosis of clinical and suspected scabies should only be made if other differential diagnoses (such as eczema and impetigo) are considered less likely than scabies.

## Complications of Scabies

### Secondary Infection

Secondary infection can occur as a result of scratching. The mites can also reduce the skin’s ability to fight bacteria. Common infections include:

- **Staphylococcal**
- **Streptococcal** infections, which may give rise to:
  - Impetigo (yellow crusted plaques and pustules)
  - Cellulitis (presents with painful swelling, redness, and fever)

Systemic sepsis caused by staphylococci and streptococci can be serious. Moreover, a scabies outbreak can lead to acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

### Crusted (Norwegian) Scabies

Crusted scabies is a highly contagious variant commonly seen in immunosuppressed patients, especially those with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Patients tend to present with:

- A generalized scaly rash, especially prominent in:
  - Finger webs
  - Wrists
  - Elbows
  - Breasts
  - Scrotum
- Sometimes affecting the scalp
- Minimal or absent itch

#### Other Risk Factors for Crusted Scabies

- Old age
- Malnutrition
- Neurological disease
- Intellectual deficit

Patients with crusted scabies may have **thousands to millions** of mites living on the skin surface. Blood tests may show raised eosinophils and immunoglobulin E (IgE). Treatment typically involves oral ivermectin and topical scabicides (e.g., permethrin 5% cream or malathion 0.5% cream), which may need to be repeated over several weeks. **Isolation** is required.

## Investigation

Patients suspected of having scabies, particularly those with household members experiencing similar issues, may be confirmed by:

- **Dermatoscopy**: May reveal a jet-plane or hang-glider appearance of the mite at the end of a burrow
- **Skin scrape**: Mites can be extracted and viewed under a microscope
- **Skin biopsy**: May reveal scabies histopathology, though this is often non-specific or negative, especially if taken from an inflammatory rash instead of the surface of a burrow

## Management (Prescribing)

1. **First-line treatment**: Topical permethrin 5% cream (scabicide)
2. **Second-line treatment**: Topical malathion 0.5% cream (scabicide)
3. **Oral antibiotics**: Required for secondary infection

**Application Instructions**:
- Scabicide cream or liquid should be applied to the whole body, including the face, scalp, and soles when the skin is dry.
- Pay closer attention to areas between fingers and toes, under nails, armpit area, and skin creases.
- Leave the product on the skin for:
  - `8-12 hours` for permethrin
  - `24 hours` for malathion
- **Reapply** if removed during the treatment period.
- Repeat treatment `8-10 days` after the first application to catch newly hatched mites.

**Alternative Treatments**:
- 25% benzyl benzoate lotion, applied daily for three days (irritant and not recommended for children)
- 2-10% precipitated sulphur ointment 
- Crotamiton cream to reduce itch (weak scabicide)

Gamma benzene hexachloride cream is no longer recommended due to neurotoxicity and suspected carcinogenicity.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

The patient should be provided with appropriate guidance on treatment for successful eradication of scabies:

- **Treat all close contacts**: All household members and people who have had close physical contact with the patient should be treated simultaneously, even if asymptomatic.
- **Avoid close contact**: Until treatment is completed.
- **Laundering**: Kill off mites by laundering, ironing, and/or tumble drying clothing, towels, and bed linens on the first day of treatment.
- **Non-washable items**: Seal in a plastic bag and store for at least one week.
- **Clean rooms**: Thoroughly with household products; fumigation is not required.
- **Vacuum**: Carpeted floors and upholstered furniture.

    question: "A 30-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 3-week history of intense itching and a rash localized to his wrists and between his fingers. He has noted similar symptoms in his roommates. Which of the following diagnostic criteria is MOST indicative of confirmed scabies in this patient?",
