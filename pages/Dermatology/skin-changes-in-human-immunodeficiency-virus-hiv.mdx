# Dermatological Disorders in HIV

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that destroys the patient’s **CD4+ T lymphocytes** and is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-infected patients often present with dermatological abnormalities with a **prevalence** that is close to 100%.

## Common Dermatological Abnormalities

HIV-related cutaneous changes can vary widely, often worsening as the disease progresses or appearing at different stages of the disease. Below is a **non-exhaustive list** of conditions causing skin changes in HIV:

- **Staphylococcal infections**
  - Bullous impetigo
  - Ecthyma
  - Folliculitis

- **Viral Infections**
  - Herpes simplex virus
  - Varicella zoster infection
  - Molluscum contagiosum
  - Human papilloma virus

- **Other Conditions**
  - Bacillary angiomatosis
  - HIV exanthem and enanthem
  - Syphilis
  - Seborrhoeic dermatitis
  - Eosinophilic folliculitis 
  - Kaposi’s sarcoma
  - Scabies
  - Candidiasis 
  - Erythema multiforme

<summary>Detailed Overview of Each Condition</summary>

### Staphylococcal Infections
- **Bullous Impetigo:** Characterized by large vesicles that burst and crust over.
- **Ecthyma:** Ulcerative infection often deeper than impetigo.
- **Folliculitis:** Infection of hair follicles leading to pustules.

### Viral Infections
- **Herpes Simplex Virus:** Can cause painful blisters and sores.
- **Varicella Zoster:** Causes shingles in later stages.
- **Molluscum Contagiosum:** Presents as round, firm, painless bumps.
- **Human Papilloma Virus:** Linked to warts and cancers.

### Other Conditions
- **Bacillary Angiomatosis:** Vascular lesions caused by bacterial infection prevalent in HIV patients.
- **HIV Exanthem and Enanthem:** Rash associated with HIV infection.
- **Syphilis:** May present with various cutaneous manifestations.
- **Seborrhoeic Dermatitis:** Scaly patches and red skin, common in immunocompromised patients.
- **Eosinophilic Folliculitis:** Characterized by itchy bumps.
- **Kaposi’s Sarcoma:** Cancer that presents with purple lesions on the skin.
- **Scabies:** Infestation by mites causing extreme itching.
- **Candidiasis:** Fungal infection presenting as red, itchy rashes.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old male with untreated HIV presents with persistent, itchy, red bumps on his arms and torso. Upon examination, the lesions are found to be raised and filled with pus, indicating a follicular infection. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Eosinophilic folliculitis",
      "Molluscum contagiosum",
      "Folliculitis",
      "Seborrhoeic dermatitis",
      "Kaposi’s sarcoma"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Folliculitis is the infection of hair follicles, leading to pus-filled bumps, and is commonly seen in HIV-infected individuals. The presentation fits the description of raised, itchy, and pus-filled lesions.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the characteristics of the lesions described and their appearance. What conditions could lead to raised, itchy, and pus-filled bumps specifically in the context of HIV?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with HIV develops a painful blistering rash. This condition is most commonly associated with which viral agent?",
    options: [
      "Human Papilloma Virus",
      "Herpes Simplex Virus",
      "Varicella Zoster Virus",
      "Candidiasis",
      "Molluscum contagiosum"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The painful blisters and sores are characteristic of Herpes Simplex Virus infections, which are common in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the type of lesions typically associated with viral infections in HIV patients. Which virus is known for causing blistering lesions particularly in immunocompromised individuals?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 50-year-old HIV-positive woman presents with a new skin lesion that is purple and raised. Considering her immunocompromised status, what is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Bacillary angiomatosis",
      "Kaposi’s sarcoma",
      "Seborrhoeic dermatitis",
      "Syphilis",
      "Erythema multiforme"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Kaposi’s sarcoma typically presents with purple lesions and is strongly associated with HIV infection. Bacillary angiomatosis can also cause vascular lesions but is generally less common compared to Kaposi's in this context.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the types of skin lesions commonly associated with HIV, particularly those that are vascular in nature. What malady is specifically known for presenting with purple lesions in such patients?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old man with AIDS comes to the clinic with widespread, scaling patches on his scalp and face. Given his immunocompromised status, which condition should be at the top of your differential diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Candidiasis",
      "Seborrhoeic dermatitis",
      "Pityriasis rosea",
      "Psoriasis",
      "Tinea capitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Seborrhoeic dermatitis is common in HIV-infected patients and often presents as scaling patches on the scalp and face, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the common skin conditions that present with scaling patches. Given the patient's AIDS diagnosis, think about which conditions are more prevalent or severe due to immunocompromise."
