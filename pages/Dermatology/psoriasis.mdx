# Psoriasis: A Comprehensive Overview

Psoriasis is a **chronic inflammatory skin disease** characterized by the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and infiltration of inflammatory cells. It typically presents with **well-defined, red, and scaly plaques** or patches on the skin.

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of psoriasis is complex and involves interactions between **environmental**, **genetic**, and **immunological factors**:

- **Genetic Factors:** Associated with **HLA-B13**, **HLA-B17**, and **HLA-C*06:02** (previously known as -Cw6).
- **Immunological Factors:** Abnormal T cell activity stimulates hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and inflammatory cytokines such as `IL-1β` and `TNF⍺`. Current theories include the TH17 pathway and the release of `IL-17A`.
- **Environmental Factors:** Can be worsened by skin trauma, leading to the **Köebner phenomenon** (new plaques at injury sites) and triggered by infections (e.g., tonsillitis) but may improve with sunlight exposure.

### Other Exacerbating Factors

- *Medications:* β-blockers, lithium, antimalarials (e.g., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, infliximab, and withdrawal of systemic steroids.
- *Lifestyle Factors:* Alcohol consumption and stress.

## Complications

- About **10%** of psoriasis cases are associated with **psoriatic arthropathy**, which can present as:
  - Symmetrical polyarthritis
  - Asymmetrical oligomonoarthritis
  - Lone distal interphalangeal disease
  - Psoriatic spondylosis
  - Arthritis mutilans

- **Other Complications:**
  - Metabolic syndrome
  - Cardiovascular disease
  - Venous thromboembolism
  - Psychological and social stress

## Diagnosis

Psoriasis affects approximately **2-4%** of the UK population, with onset possible at any age (common peaks at 15–25 years and 50–60 years). It typically has a lifelong course, fluctuating in extent and severity, with about one-third of patients having a family history.

### Features

- **Plaque Characteristics:**
  - Well-demarcated erythematous scaly plaques, potentially itchy, painful, or burning
  - Common areas: extensor surfaces (elbows, knees) and scalp
  - **Auspitz Sign:** Gentle scratching causes capillary bleeding
  - Approximately **50%** may exhibit nail changes (nail psoriasis)

### Psoriasis Subtypes

1. **Chronic Plaque Psoriasis**
   - Most common subtype; persistent with red and scaly plaques of >3cm

2. **Small Plaque Psoriasis**
   - Late age of onset with plaques `<3cm`

3. **Unstable Plaque Psoriasis**
   - Rapid extension of plaques, triggered by factors like infection, stress, or drug withdrawal

4. **Flexural Psoriasis**
   - Affects body folds and genitals with smooth patches; can be colonized by candida

5. **Seborrhoeic Psoriasis**
   - Overlaps with seborrhoeic dermatitis; involves areas like the face and scalp; often colonized by *Malassezia*

6. **Guttate Psoriasis**
   - More common in children and adolescents; characterized by teardrop papules, often triggered by streptococcal infections

7. **Pustular Psoriasis**
   - Affects mainly palms and soles

8. **Nail Psoriasis**
   - Features include nail pitting, onycholysis, and associated inflammatory arthritis

9. **Erythrodermic Psoriasis (rare)**
   - Total body redness; may lead to systemic illness

## Investigations

Diagnosis primarily relies on clinical features, with skin biopsy reserved for confirmation in ambiguous cases. Important assessment parameters include:

1. **Disease Severity**
2. **Impact on Physical, Psychological, and Social Well-being**
3. **Presence of Psoriatic Arthritis**
4. **Comorbidities**

#### Validated Evaluation Tools for Disease Severity

- Physician's Global Assessment
- Patient's Global Assessment
- Body Surface Area (BSA)
- Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
- Nail Psoriasis Severity Index

#### Validated Tools for Quality of Life Assessment

- Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
- Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI)

#### Monitoring for Associated Comorbidities

- Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST)
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Blood sugar and HbA1c level
- Lipid profile and uric acid level

## Management

### General Advice

- Avoid known precipitating factors like smoking and excessive alcohol.
- Maintain optimal weight.
- Use emollients to alleviate dryness and scales.

### Treatment Strategy

- **First-Line Treatment:** Topical therapy
- **Second/Third-Line Treatment:** Consider phototherapy or systemic therapy for extensive disease, classified as:
  - `>10%` body surface area affected
  - At least "moderate" on the static Physician's Global Assessment
  - Inadequate effect from topical treatment for psoriatic nail disease

### Specific Treatment Approaches

#### For Psoriasis Affecting Trunk and Limbs

- **First Line:** Potent topical corticosteroids + vitamin D analogues (apply separately)
- **Subsequent Lines:** Adjust corticosteroid use based on response; consider other topical alternatives.

#### For Scalp Psoriasis

- Use potent topical corticosteroids and application methods to manage adherent scales.

#### For Face, Flexural, and Genital Psoriasis

- Employ mild or moderate potency corticosteroids, sparingly.

### Secondary Care Management

#### For Extensive Disease

- Phototherapy: `UVB` three times weekly
- PUVA therapy: Psoralen + `UVA` with topical combination

#### For Systemic Involvement

- **First Line:** Oral methotrexate
- Alternatives include ciclosporin, systemic retinoids, among others.

#### For Conventional Treatment-Resistant Severe Psoriasis

- **Biologics or Targeted Therapies** such as anti-TNFα (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab) and IL-12/IL-23 antagonists (ustekinumab). Note the potential for side effects and cost considerations.

### Important Considerations for Topical Therapy

- Be cautious of side effects like skin atrophy and rebound symptoms, particularly in sensitive areas (face, scalp, and flexures). Guidelines recommend intermittent use to mitigate risks.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a 6-month history of itchy, red, scaly patches on her elbows and knees. She reports that these lesions sometimes bleed upon scratching. A family history of psoriasis is noted. What key feature would you expect to see upon examination?",
