# Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)

Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a rare but acute mucocutaneous reaction affecting the skin, mucous membranes, digestive tracts, genitals, and eyes. In severe cases, SJS may lead to systemic complications, including multiorgan failure. It is characterized by epidermal loss and multisite mucositis associated with systemic disturbance.

## Conditions Related to SJS

**Stevens-Johnson Syndrome** and **Toxic Epidermal Necrosis (TEN)** are now believed to be variants of the same condition, falling within a severity spectrum:

- **SJS:** Less extensive, affecting `<10%` of body surface area.
- **TEN:** More extensive, affecting `>30%` of body surface area.

**Erythema Multiforme (EMM)** is a similar condition, generally less severe, primarily triggered by infections rather than medications.

### **Epidemiology**

- **Incidence:** Approximately 1–2 cases per million annually.
- **Mortality:** Less than 10%, with significant long-term sequelae in survivors.

## Causes of SJS

### **In Children:**
- Often triggered by **viral infections**:
  - Mumps
  - Flu
  - Herpes simplex virus
  - Coxsackie virus
  - Epstein-Barr virus

### **In Adults:**
SJS is frequently caused by an unpredictable adverse reaction to medications, including:

- Allopurinol
- Carbamazepine
- Lamotrigine
- Nevirapine 
- “Oxicam” class of anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., meloxicam and piroxicam)
- Phenobarbital
- Phenytoin
- Sulfamethoxazole and other “sulfa” antibiotics
- Sertraline
- Sulfasalazine

> When a causative drug cannot be identified, consider **infective causes** such as mycoplasma infection.

## Risk Factors

- **Viral infections:** Herpes, hepatitis, viral pneumonia, or HIV
- **Immunocompromised states:** AIDS, autoimmune conditions (e.g., SLE), chemotherapy, organ transplants
- **Previous history of SJS:** Risk of recurrence if taking certain medications that previously triggered SJS
- **Family history:** Especially with close family members affected
- **Genetic predisposition:** Particularly in individuals of Chinese descent with *HLA-B1502* and *HLA-B1508* genes.

## Clinical Features

SJS often begins with **prodromal flu-like symptoms** lasting several days before skin eruptions.

### Symptoms Include:
- Feeling generally unwell (malaise)
- High fever (`≥ 38°C`)
- Headache 
- Joint pain 
- Cough 

_Ocular inflammation may develop before skin signs._

### **Stages of Skin Presentation:**
- **Cutaneous pain:** Prominent early feature.
- **Initial lesions:** Atypical targets or purpuric macules on the upper torso, proximal limbs, and face. 
- **Spread:** Rash can expand over hours or days. 
- **Blistering:** Leads to flaccid bullae and painful sores. 
- **Dermal exposure:** Detachment of the epidermis can lead to infection and bleeding.
- **Facial swelling:** Swollen lips with crusty sores, mucous membranes often affected.

### **Details on Symptoms**
<details>
<summary>Common Signs and Symptoms</summary>

- **Cutaneous pain**
- **Rash:** Target lesions and widespread erythema
- **Blistering**
- **Swollen lips**
- **Mucosal involvement:** Ulcerative and haemorrhagic mucositis

</details>

## Complications

### **Cutaneous Manifestations:**
- Uneven skin color post-healing
- Scarring (less common)
- Secondary cellulitis may lead to sepsis

### **Extracutaneous Manifestations:**
| System Affected | Potential Complications |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Respiratory      | Pneumonia, bronchial obstruction |
| Cardiac          | Myocarditis            |
| Renal            | Acute kidney injury    |
| Hepatic          | Mild liver enzyme elevation |
| Gastrointestinal  | Oesophageal stricture, profuse diarrhea |
| Ocular           | Irritation, dry eyes, corneal ulceration |
| Reproductive     | Vaginal stenosis, penile scarring |

## Diagnosis

### **Clinical Diagnosis:**
Patients with suspected SJS should be promptly referred to a dermatologist and admitted to the hospital for treatment.

#### **Key Clinical Signs:**
- Tender skin lesions
- Target lesions, blisters, mucositis, and epidermal detachment
- **Nikolsky sign**: Minimal shearing causes epidermis to peel away.

### **Primary Management Plan:**
1. Discontinue potential culprit drugs immediately.
2. Establish venous access through non-lesional skin.
3. Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation if necessary.
4. Monitor hydration and nutrition—use a nasogastric tube if needed.
5. Insert a urinary catheter if dysuria or retention occurs.
6. Estimate body surface area involvement using the **Lund and Browder chart**.

## Investigations

### **Blood Tests Include:**
- Full blood count
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
- C-reactive protein (CRP)
- Urea and electrolytes (U&Es)
- Liver function tests
- Coagulation studies
- Mycoplasma serology

### **Other Investigations:**
- Chest X-ray
- Skin biopsies
- Organize clinical photographs documenting the lesions

> **SCORTEN** is a scoring system that predicts hospital mortality based on 7 clinical parameters, calculated within the first 24 hours of admission.

## Management

### **Prescribing Management:**
- Analgesia for skin pain
- Mouthwashes for symptomatic relief
- Corticosteroids under specialist advice
- Systemic antibiotics for suspected infections
- Eye drops for ocular symptoms
- Regular cleansing of wounds and applying emollients

### **Non-Prescribing Management:**
Patients should be managed in an appropriate environment to minimize infection risk. This involves:

- Barrier nursing in a controlled humidity environment 
- Maintaining an ambient temperature of `25-28°C` 

### **Prevention**
- Avoid the culprit medication for the rest of life.
- Warn family members of potential genetic susceptibility.
- Genetic testing for *HLA-B1502* and *HLA-B1508* may be advised for at-risk populations.

  {
    question: "A 35-year-old male patient presents with fever, sore throat, and a painful rash that started on his torso and spread rapidly over a few days, leading to the detachment of skin. Upon examination, you note target lesions and mucosal involvement. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis",
      "Erythema Multiforme",
      "Stevens-Johnson Syndrome",
      "Kawasaki Disease",
      "Pemphigus Vulgaris"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient's symptoms and signs are highly suggestive of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), particularly the mucosal involvement and target lesions. Unlike Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), which affects over 30% of body surface area, SJS typically involves less than 10%. Erythema Multiforme is also less severe and typically triggered by infections rather than medications.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the definitions and distinctions between SJS and related skin conditions. Pay particular attention to the percentage of body surface area affected and the presence of mucosal lesions in your considerations."
  },
  {
    question: "A 23-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy presents with skin symptoms, including fever and painful lesions predominantly located on her trunk.
