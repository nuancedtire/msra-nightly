# Venous Leg Ulcers

Venous leg ulcers, also referred to as **stasis**, **insufficiency**, or **varicose ulcers**, are open wounds in the skin of the lower leg due to underlying sustained venous hypertension. This occurs when incompetent valves in the deep and perforating veins of the lower leg result in retrograde flow of blood to the superficial venous system and a consequent rise in capillary pressure. The increased pressure causes extravasation of fibrinogen through capillary walls, leading to pericapillary fibrin deposition and impaired oxygenation of local tissues and surrounding skin. This skin becomes itchy, dry, and inflamed. Owing to the poor blood supply, the skin is prone to breaking down easily, resulting in an open wound after minimal trauma.

## Diagnosis

**Venous valves** tend to weaken with age. Therefore, ulcers are common in later life, affecting approximately `1%` of the population over the age of `70 years`. Other risk factors include:

- **Venous damage** after a deep vein thrombosis
- **Familial valve weakness**

Venous ulcers are most commonly found on the medial lower leg above the ankles, often termed the ‘gaiter’ area.

### Associated Conditions

They are often associated with:

- Oedema of the lower legs
- Venous eczema
- Brown haemosiderin pigmentation
- Varicose veins
- **Lipodermatosclerosis** (firm induration due to fibrosis of the subcutaneous fat)
- **Atrophie blanche** (scarring white atrophy with telangiectasia)

### Characteristics of the Ulcer

The ulcer itself is typically characterized as:

- A **shallow open wound**
- **Irregular margins**
- A bed of **moist, red tissue**, often covered in a yellowish-grey layer
- Can leak a significant amount of fluid
- Usually **relatively painless**

### Complications

Complications of venous ulceration include:

- Bacterial colonisation and infection
- **Marjolin’s ulcer** – the development of a squamous cell carcinoma in a long-standing venous ulcer

## Investigations

### Diagnostic Tools

- **Doppler ultrasound**: 
  - Will demonstrate retrograde flow or prolonged valve closure time (`>0.5 seconds`).
  
- **Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)**:
  - Must be performed before compression to exclude significant arterial disease.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Pentoxifylline**: Has shown some benefit in venous leg ulcer healing, especially in combination with compression therapy.
- **Emollient cream**: For treating dry skin.
- **Antibiotics**: For any indication of infection.
- **Steroid cream**: For managing venous eczema on the skin surrounding the ulcer.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Compression Therapy

- Compression therapy with **graded knee-high compression stockings** is the mainstay of care for venous ulcers and chronic venous insufficiency. Compression classes include:
  - Class `1` (light compression)
  - Class `3` (high compression)

### Other Key Principles

- **Leg elevation** is crucial. Elevating the lower extremities above heart level reduces oedema, decreases venous hypertension, and promotes ulcer healing.
- Dressings may be used under compression bandages to promote faster healing and to prevent the bandage from adhering to the ulcer.

### Surgical Options

- After six months of treatment, if the ulcer is still present:
  - **Surgical debridement** may be indicated to remove necrotic tissue and enhance healing.
  - **Skin grafting** may be considered for patients with large or refractory venous ulcers.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old man presents to the clinic with a history of recurrent venous leg ulcers on his left lower leg. He has a significant history of deep vein thrombosis and varicose veins. Upon examination, his ulcers are located in the gaiter area and exhibit irregular margins with a moist, red base. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management strategy for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Immediate surgical debridement of the ulcer",
      "Commencement of antibiotics for possible infection",
      "Application of graded compression stockings",
      "Administration of pentoxifylline",
      "Elevation of the left leg above heart level"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Initial management of venous ulcers focuses on compression therapy and leg elevation to reduce venous hypertension. While pentoxifylline may be beneficial and antibiotics may be required later if infection is confirmed, the most appropriate immediate management for healing and preventing recurrence begins with graded compression stockings and leg elevation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember, the cornerstone of managing venous ulcers includes optimization of venous return. Consider methods that address venous hypertension and edema while fostering an environment conducive to healing. Evaluate what options would provide immediate benefits to the patient."
  },
  {
    question: "A 68-year-old woman is diagnosed with a venous leg ulcer following an episode of deep vein thrombosis. In addition to compression therapy, which of the following adjunct treatments has shown evidence of benefit for promoting ulcer healing?",
    options: [
      "Corticosteroid cream",
      "Pentoxifylline",
      "Topical antiseptics",
      "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy",
      "Systemic antibiotics"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Pentoxifylline has been shown to promote healing of venous ulcers when used in conjunction with compression therapy. This treatment works by improving blood flow and reducing blood viscosity. Other options may have varying degrees of benefit, but none are as directly supported by evidence for venous ulcer healing as pentoxifylline.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which treatments target the underlying mechanisms of venous ulcers and support tissue repair. Reflect on the role of improving circulation and oxygenation in ulcer healing."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient presents with a venous ulcer characterized by brown pigmentation around the edges and a surrounding area of induration. What additional condition should the clinician be aware of when examining this ulcer?",
    options: [
      "Ethosuximide therapy complication",
      "Presence of a Marjolin’s ulcer",
      "Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum",
      "Silver sulfadiazine reaction",
      "Pyoderma gangrenosum"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of brown pigmentation and firm induration around the ulcer may indicate chronic changes due to venous insufficiency, and clinicians should keep in mind the risk of Marjolin’s ulcer, a squamous cell carcinoma that can arise in chronic ulcers. Monitoring for any suspicious changes in the ulcer is warranted.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the potential complications associated with chronic venous ulcers. Consider how long-standing ulcers may change over time and what new developments could signal a need for further investigation."
  },
  {
    question: "A 70-year-old man with a history of chronic venous insufficiency presents with a painful, shallow ulcer located on the medial aspect of his left lower leg. He has been using compression stockings but complains of discomfort. What is the most appropriate modification to consider in his treatment plan?",
    options: [
      "Switch to a higher compression class stocking",
      "Reduce the frequency of using compression stockings",
      "Utilize a different form of wound dressing",
      "Incorporate leg elevation strategies",
      "Discontinue all compression therapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Incorporating leg elevation is crucial to managing venous ulcers, as it helps reduce edema and facilitates healing. While compression is important, the patient should also practice elevating his legs above heart level several times a day. This strategy complements the use of compression therapy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the underlying principles of venous ulcer management. What strategies can help reduce swelling and improve symptoms of venous insufficiency without compromising the protective effects of compression?"
