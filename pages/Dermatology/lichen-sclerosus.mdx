# Lichen Sclerosus

Lichen Sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects the genital and perianal areas, with a higher prevalence in elderly women. Historically, it has been referred to by various names, including:

- **Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus**
- **Kraurosis vulvae** (in women)
- **Balanitis xerotica obliterans** (in males)

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of Lichen Sclerosus is based on clinical features, which typically include:

- **White crinkled and/or thickened patches of skin**
- **Itching** and **soreness** 

### Specific Types of Lichen Sclerosus

- **Vulval Lichen Sclerosus:**
  - Affects the non-hair bearing inner areas of the vulva.
  - May spread to surrounding labia majora and anal/perianal areas.
  - Does **not** involve the vaginal mucosa.

- **Penile Lichen Sclerosus:**
  - Most commonly affects the tip of the penis (glans).
  - Can lead to phimosis and impaired sexual function.

- **Extragenital Lichen Sclerosus:**
  - May occur on the inner thigh, buttocks, abdomen, under the breasts, and lower back.

Diagnosis is primarily clinical; however, a skin biopsy may be recommended. The biopsy can be used for follow-up to evaluate treatment response or investigate areas of concern.

## Investigations

A skin biopsy is essential for:

- Confirming or excluding the diagnosis.
- Assessing for **cancer** or other conditions through histopathology.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **1st line:** 
  - **Topical steroids** (commonly ultrapotent)
    - E.g., clobetasol propionate `0.05%`
  - For *mild disease* or when symptoms are controlled, a potent steroid like mometasone furoate `0.1%` may be used.

- **Severe/Acute Cases:**
  - If not responding to topical therapy, consider systemic treatments such as:
    - Systemic corticosteroids
    - Oral retinoids
    - Methotrexate
    - Ciclosporin

- **Other Options:**
  - **Intravaginal oestrogen cream/pessaries** for post-menopausal women.
  - **Topical calcineurin inhibitors.**
  - **Topical retinoids.**

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### General Measures:

- Wash gently once or twice daily.
- Use a **non-soap cleanser**.
- Avoid tight clothing.
- If incontinence is present, seek medical advice.
- **Photographs** may assist in monitoring treatment response.
- **Long-term follow-up** is recommended for disease monitoring.

**Warning:** It is essential to rule out malignancy in cases of suspected Lichen Sclerosus, particularly in older patients presenting with genital symptoms.

  {
    question: "A 70-year-old female patient presents with severe itching and white patches on her vulva. Upon examination, you note thickened skin changes in the non-hair bearing areas. A biopsy is performed, revealing no malignancy. What is the most appropriate first-line treatment for her condition?",
    options: [
      "Topical calcineurin inhibitors",
      "Systemic corticosteroids",
      "Topical steroids (ultrapotent)",
      "Oral retinoids",
      "Intravaginal estrogen cream"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The first-line treatment for Lichen Sclerosus involves potent topical steroids, like clobetasol propionate, which are effective in reducing the severity of the symptoms and promoting skin healing.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the typical treatment pathways for Lichen Sclerosus. First-line management focuses on topical medications; think about which type of topical steroid would offer the most effective relief for severe symptoms."
  },
  {
    question: "In a case of Lichen Sclerosus affecting the penis, what potential complication should be monitored for during follow-up?",
    options: [
      "Vaginal mucosal involvement",
      "Urinary incontinence",
      "Phimosis and impaired sexual function",
      "Chronic pain syndrome",
      "Alopecia areata"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Penile Lichen Sclerosus can lead to complications such as phimosis and sexual dysfunction due to changes in skin morphology. Monitoring these effects is crucial in management.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the specific manifestations of Lichen Sclerosus in males. What anatomical changes would occur due to the disease that could lead to functional impairments?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old woman diagnosed with vulval Lichen Sclerosus is being treated with topical steroids. She reports initial relief of symptoms but is now experiencing worsening discomfort. What should be the next step in her management?",
    options: [
      "Switch to oral retinoids",
      "Increase the potency of the topical steroid",
      "Add topical calcineurin inhibitors",
      "Consider systemic therapies",
      "Discontinue all medications"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! If symptoms are worsening despite topical therapy, it may be necessary to escalate treatment to include systemic therapies to achieve better control of the disease.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the reasons why a patient's symptoms might worsen despite treatment. Consider the factors that could necessitate a change in management approach, especially when topical treatments are insufficient."

  {
    question: "Which of the following is a key consideration when diagnosing Lichen Sclerosus in older patients presenting with genital symptoms?",
    options: [
      "Presence of vaginal mucosal involvement",
      "Necessity for immediate surgical intervention",
      "Exclusion of underlying malignancy",
      "Diagnosis is primarily through serological tests",
      "Management includes aggressive phototherapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! It is crucial to rule out malignancy, especially in older patients with genital symptoms, as Lichen Sclerosus can be associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember the importance of a thorough evaluation in older patients presenting with genital symptoms. What serious underlying conditions must be considered and ruled out in these cases?"
