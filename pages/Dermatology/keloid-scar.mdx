# Keloid Scarring: Diagnosis and Management

A **keloid** is an abnormal proliferation of scar tissue that forms at the site of injury. It is classified as a benign dermal fibroproliferative tumor with **no malignant potential**. Keloids typically develop in response to trauma or inflammation to the dermis, such as:

- **Acne**
- **Piercings**
- **Tattoos**
- **Vaccinations**
- **Surgery**

Keloids commonly occur in individuals aged **10-30 years** and are rare in those over **65 years**.

Individuals with darker skin pigmentation are more likely to develop keloid scarring, which can also have a familial tendency. **Keloid-susceptibility loci** have been identified on chromosomes, suggesting a genetic component. Resistance to apoptosis in keloid fibroblasts may contribute to the progressive nature of keloids; however, they typically stabilize after initial proliferation.

**Psychological Impact**: Keloid scarring can affect patients psychologically due to its often unsightly appearance. There is also a risk of infection, which may present as a small abscess within the scar tissue. Overall, keloid scarring is complex to treat, with varying responses to treatment among different patients. Relapse is common.

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors

Risk factors for developing a keloid scar include:

- **History of previous keloid scars**
- **Darker skin types**
- **Family history**
- **Trauma**: Keloid scarring is an attempt at repair in response to injury.

Keloid scarring is typically diagnosed clinically; a skin biopsy is usually not indicated, as it may worsen the scarring. Although keloids are often asymptomatic, they can sometimes be itchy or cause a tingling sensation during their active growth phase.

### Clinical Presentation

Keloids frequently occur in the following locations:

- **Earlobes** (e.g., from piercings)
- **Presternal region**
- **Deltoid area**
  
Other keloids may appear due to surgical scars and typically have a linear appearance.

**Characteristics of Keloids**:

- **Appearance**: Smooth, shiny surface with an overhanging edge.
- **Size**: Larger than the original trauma/incision mark.
- **Color**: Can vary with skin pigmentation; may appear erythematous during the active phase due to increased blood flow. Once stabilized, keloids may become similar in color to surrounding skin.

## Management

In managing keloid scars, it is crucial to avoid further inciting events (e.g., piercings) and to maintain proper skin hygiene.

### Therapeutic Options

Various therapies are available to improve the cosmetic appearance of keloid scars:

- **Silicone-based therapy**: Available as gel/spray or gel sheets; can improve scar thickness and color with persistent use, but results vary.
- **Intralesional corticosteroids** ± **lidocaine**: Lidocaine may reduce collagen production and inhibit cell proliferation, while corticosteroids help thin the skin and enhance the scar's appearance.
- **Topical corticosteroids**: Useful for children and when intralesional injection is painful.
- **Laser therapy**: Administered only by a specialist (plastic surgeon or dermatologist); aims to destroy blood vessels in the scar, inducing local ischemia and apoptosis in fibroblasts. Limited evidence supports its effectiveness.
- **Cryotherapy**: Induces cell death without denaturing collagen.
- **Pressure therapy**: Maintains pressure on the scar using elastic garments to promote local tissue hypoxia.

### Surgical Treatment

Surgery is a second-line treatment considered only for patients with a poor response to first-line options. Caution is essential, as surgery can lead to recurrence and extension of the keloid.

  {
    question: "A 24-year-old male with a history of keloids presents to the clinic with a raised, shiny scar on his earlobe after getting a piercing. He is concerned about its appearance. Which of the following treatments is considered a first-line option to improve the scar's cosmetic appearance?",
    options: [
      "Surgical excision",
      "Intralesional corticosteroid injections",
      "Cryotherapy",
      "Pressure therapy",
      "Topical silicone therapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Topical silicone therapy is often recommended as a first-line treatment for keloids due to its effectiveness in improving scar appearance and its non-invasive nature. Persistent use can help with both thickness and color of the scar. Other options may be considered, but surgical excision particularly poses a risk of recurrence.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the options that are commonly used as first-line treatments for keloids. Think about non-invasive methods that have demonstrated effectiveness in improving keloid scarring without the high recurrence risk associated with surgical options."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following individuals is at the highest risk for developing keloid scarring?",
    options: [
      "A 15-year-old girl with no history of skin conditions",
      "A 30-year-old man with a family history of keloids",
      "A 70-year-old woman with a history of diabetes",
      "A newborn with no notable risk factors",
      "A 28-year-old woman who recently had a tattoo"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Family history and genetics play a significant role in the susceptibility to keloid formation. Individuals with relatives who have experienced keloids are at a higher risk. The other options present individuals without the same level of risk factors related to keloids.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the risk factors for keloids. Consider both genetic predispositions and previous skin injuries or conditions. Which option best encompasses these elements?"
  },
  {
    question: "During a follow-up visit, a 30-year-old female presents with a painful, itchy keloid on her sternum following surgery. What is the most appropriate initial step in management for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Surgical excision of the keloid",
      "Intralesional corticosteroid injection",
      "Laser therapy",
      "Cryotherapy",
      "Topical antibiotic ointment"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Intralesional corticosteroid injections are often effective for treating symptomatic keloids, especially when there is itching or pain. These injections can help reduce inflammation and the size of the keloid over time. Surgical excision can be considered later but carries a high risk of recurrence.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the most effective and immediate options available specifically for symptomatic keloids. Surgical interventions might seem appealing but often lead to more complications in keloid management."
  },
  {
    question: "A 40-year-old man with a history of keloids is considering treatment options after developing a large keloid following a surgery. Which of the following statements regarding the management of keloids is true?",
    options: [
      "Surgery is always the first-line treatment for keloids.",
      "Cryotherapy is effective for all types of keloid scars.",
      "Keloids can recur after surgical removal, requiring further management.",
      "Topical treatments have no role in keloid management.",
      "Keloids are not influenced by family history."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Keloids can frequently recur following surgical intervention, making careful consideration and sometimes additional treatments necessary. Understanding the potential outcomes can help inform treatment strategies.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Revisit the information related to keloid management. Consider the treatment modalities and their implications. What is known about the recurrence of keloids after surgical procedures?"
