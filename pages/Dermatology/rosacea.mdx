# Rosacea: A Comprehensive Overview

Rosacea is a type of chronic skin rash with unknown aetiology. It may be transient, persistent, or recurrent, and it commonly affects the centre of the face. Individuals with rosacea are characterised by a **red coloured face**, caused by dilated facial blood vessels, which give the cheeks and nose a flushed appearance. Although it was previously known as **acne rosacea**, it is unrelated to acne vulgaris. Unlike acne vulgaris, there are no blackheads or whiteheads in rosacea.

## Diagnosis

Rosacea typically occurs between `30 to 60 years` of age but can manifest at any age. It is more common in **women** with **blue eyes**, **fair skin**, and **Celtic origin**.

### Features:

- Primarily affects the **central face** (nose, forehead, chin, and cheek including the nasolabial fold).
- **Transient flushing and blushing** are often the first symptoms, followed by persistent erythema with **papules** (red spots) and **pustules** (dome-shaped rather than pointed).
- **Telangiectasia** (dilatation of capillaries).
- **Burning and stinging** sensitive skin, particularly in reaction to oil-based cosmetic and sunscreen products.
- **Rosacea dermatitis** (dry and scaling skin).
- **Morbihan disease** – persistent redness and swelling or solid oedema of the upper face due to lymphatic obstruction.
- **Aggravating factors** include sun exposure, hot and spicy food, alcohol, or anything that reddens the face.

### Subtypes of Rosacea:

- **Papulopustular rosacea**: A classic presentation with persistent central facial erythema associated with transient papules and/or pustules located centrally or peri-orally, often with a burning or stinging sensation.

- **Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea**: Characterised by flushing and persistent central facial erythema (sparing perioral and periorbital skin) with or without telangiectasia.

- **Phymatous rosacea**: Thickening skin and irregular surface nodularity, including:
  - **Rhinophyma**: An enlarged and distorted nose shape with prominent pores and fibrous thickening.
  - Other rarer phymatous changes can occur on the eyelids (blepharophyma), chin (gnathophyma), forehead (metophyma), and ears (otophyma).

- **Ocular rosacea**: Symptoms include dryness, itching, blurred vision, foreign body sensation in the eye, burning or stinging, ocular photosensitivity, telangiectasia of the sclera, and periorbital oedema. It may also present with **blepharitis**, **conjunctivitis**, **keratitis**, or **episcleritis**.

### Variants of Rosacea:

- **Granulomatous rosacea**: Persistent, non-inflammatory hard yellowish-brown or pinkish cutaneous papules and nodules, primarily around the cheeks, eyes, and mouth.

## Investigation

In most cases, no investigation is required as rosacea is primarily diagnosed based on clinical findings from history and physical examination. A **skin biopsy** may be performed occasionally when the diagnosis is uncertain, revealing vascular changes and chronic inflammation of skin cells. 

The **Global ROSacea COnsensus (ROSCO)** Panel recommended a standardised classification system in `2018` for diagnosing rosacea based on **diagnostic**, **major**, and **minor phenotypes**. One diagnostic or two major phenotypes are required to meet the diagnostic criteria of rosacea.

### Diagnostic Phenotypes Include:

- Fixed central facial erythema in a characteristic pattern that may periodically intensify.
- Phymatous changes.

### Major Phenotypes Include:

- Flushing
- Papules and pustules
- Telangiectasia
- Ocular rosacea

### Minor Phenotypes Include:

- Dry appearance
- Oedema
- Burning or stinging sensation

## Management (Prescribing)

### Topical Treatment:

- For mild-to-moderate papules and/or pustules, prescribe **topical ivermectin** (an antihelmintic and insecticidal preparation) once daily for `8–12 weeks`.
  - Alternative options include **metronidazole 0.75%** applied twice daily or **azelaic acid 15%** applied twice daily for pregnant or breastfeeding women if ivermectin is not suitable.

- For moderate-to-severe papules and/or pustules, prescribe a combination of topical ivermectin and **oral doxycycline 40 mg** once daily as a modified-release preparation for `8–12 weeks`, based on local prescribing guidelines.

### Systemic Antibiotics:

- **Oral tetracycline antibiotics**, including doxycycline and minocycline, are commonly prescribed for severe rosacea for `6-12 weeks` (dose and duration adjusted according to severity). They can reduce erythema, pustules, and papules while improving ocular rosacea symptoms. 
- Other oral antibiotics such as **metronidazole** or **cotrimoxazole** are for resistant cases.

### Other Adjuvant Treatments:

- **Low dose oral isotretinoin** may be used for long-term treatment but is not suitable for everyone due to side effects (dry lips, swelling of eyelids, nosebleeds, gastrointestinal upset, hair-thinning).
  
- Medications to reduce flushing and vascular dilatation: **clonidine** (alpha2-receptor agonist) and **carvedilol** (non-selective beta-blocker). Side effects include hypotension, dry eyes, blurred vision, bradycardia, and gastrointestinal upset.

- **Anti-inflammatory agents**: Oral diclofenac may reduce redness and discomfort of affected skin.
  
- **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream may alleviate some symptoms.

### General Measures:

- **Reduce factors causing facial flushing**: Avoid hot and spicy foods, alcohol, hot showers, baths, and warm rooms.
- Replace oil-based cosmetic products with water-based alternatives.
- *Avoid using topical steroids*, which may provide short-term improvement but worsen rosacea over time.
- Daily application of high-factor light, oil-free facial sunscreen is crucial to protect against sun exposure.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Vascular laser therapy** or intense pulsed light treatment may be recommended for patients with persistent telangiectasia. Alternatives include **diathermy** (electrosurgery), **sclerotherapy** (saline injections), and **cautery**. 
- Papulopustular rosacea may improve with **radiofrequency** or **laser therapy**.
- Patients with **rhinophyma** should be referred to a dermatologist and plastic surgeon for surgical reshaping or treatment with a carbon dioxide laser.
