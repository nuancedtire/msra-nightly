# Acne Vulgaris: Understanding Diagnosis and Management

Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory disease that results in a chronic pustular rash on the face, neck, chest, and back. Most teenagers suffer from acne vulgaris (Latin for *common*), but only a minority require medical treatment. Treatment follows a step-up management pathway, starting with topical therapies and progressing to oral medications. Despite the effectiveness of acne vulgaris treatments, various challenges (both medical and social) can accompany their use.

## Diagnosis

The rash of acne vulgaris is caused by obstruction of pilosebaceous units, which consist of hair follicles and associated sebaceous glands. The rash is characterized by lesions categorized in **Table 1**.

Acne vulgaris is diagnosed and classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the extent and types of skin lesions.

- **Mild:** Few comedones and inflammatory lesions.
- **Moderate:** Extensive comedones and widespread inflammatory lesions.
- **Severe:** Extensive inflammatory lesions, including deeper lesions such as nodules and cysts.

#### Table 1. Acne vulgaris lesions

| Cause of lesion                | Type of lesion                     | Severity of acne vulgaris      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Primary (non-inflammatory)** | Closed comedones (`whiteheads`)   | Mild                           |
|                                | Open comedones (`blackheads`)     | Mild                           |
| **Inflammatory lesions**       | Papules (`small red spots`)       | Moderate or Severe             |
|                                | Pustules (`white or yellow spots`) | Moderate or Severe             |
|                                | Nodules (`large red spots`)       | Moderate or Severe             |
|                                | Cysts                              | Moderate or Severe             |
| **Secondary lesions**          | Scars                              | More common with increasing severity |
|                                | Pigmentation changes               | More common with increasing severity |
|                                | Excoriations                       | More common with increasing severity |

## Investigations

Most patients with acne vulgaris do not require further investigations. However, severe acne that is refractory to treatment should be investigated for secondary causes, such as:

- Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)
- Pituitary adenomas
- Anabolic steroid use

Children with acne vulgaris exhibiting signs of virilization (i.e., male secondary sex characteristics in girls or precociously in boys) should have their serum androgen levels measured.

## Management (Prescribing)

The first-line treatment for acne is with topical benzoyl peroxide. Treatment may need to be escalated based on the patient's response and initial severity, as outlined in **Table 2**:

- Combination topical therapy (e.g., benzoyl peroxide + retinoid or antibiotic)
- Oral antibiotics
- Combined oral contraceptives (for anti-androgen activity)
- Isotretinoin (`Roaccutane`)

#### Table 2. Drugs used to treat acne vulgaris

| Severity of acne vulgaris | Route of administration | Drug class/name                          | Considerations                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Mild                      | Topical                | Benzoyl peroxide                         |                                                |
| Mild                      | Topical                | Retinoids                                | Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding |
| Moderate                  | Topical                | Antibiotics (`ABX`)                     |                                                |
| Moderate                  | Oral                   | `ABX` (tetracycline or lymecycline)    | Co-administered with topical agents (not topical `ABX`) |
| Moderate                  | Oral                   | Combined oral contraceptive              | In females, if signs of PCOS; co-administered with topical agents |
| Severe                    | Oral                   | Isotretinoin                             | Specialist care only; pregnancy test, blood monitoring |

Retinoids, such as isotretinoin, are highly teratogenic. Oral isotretinoin can only be prescribed by dermatologists following a negative pregnancy test for females and a set of baseline blood tests (usually FBC, LFTs, and lipids). Isotretinoin can cause haematological, liver, and lipid abnormalities, as well as an initial acne flare-up and dry skin. It is also linked with arthralgia and epistaxis.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Self-hygiene advice is an essential aspect of managing acne vulgaris, including:

- Regular face washing
- Avoiding irritant cosmetics and abrasive skin treatments
- Not picking at spots

The link between acne vulgaris and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and specific foods, remains inconclusive. It is crucial to emphasize to patients that their acne vulgaris is not their fault.

**Warning:** Isotretinoin is highly teratogenic. All females of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test prior to prescription.

  {
    question: "A 16-year-old male presents with extensive acne vulgaris characterized by numerous open and closed comedones and moderate inflammatory lesions on his face and back. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line treatment for his condition?",
    options: [
      "Topical retinoids",
      "Isotretinoin",
      "Benzoyl peroxide",
      "Oral antibiotics",
      "Combined oral contraceptives"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Benzoyl peroxide is the first-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris and serves as an effective topical agent against bacteria and comedones. It is important for this patient to start with topical therapy before considering oral antibiotics or more aggressive treatments like isotretinoin.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the severity of this patient's acne. The first-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris typically involves topical therapies. While other options may be effective, it's essential to follow treatment guidelines starting with the least aggressive approach."
  },
  {
    question: "A 24-year-old woman with persistent moderate acne is evaluated for treatment options. She is diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Which of the following treatment options is most appropriate for her?",
    options: [
      "Oral isotretinoin",
      "Topical benzoyl peroxide",
      "Combined oral contraceptives",
      "Oral tetracycline antibiotics",
      "Retinoids"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In females with PCOS, combined oral contraceptives are often used for their anti-androgen effects and help to regulate menstrual cycles while also reducing acne. They are especially indicated in patients with acne related to hormonal imbalances.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the hormonal aspect of this patient's condition. In cases of acne associated with PCOS, treatments that address hormonal factors can be particularly effective. Think about the medications that have this effect."
  },
  {
    question: "A 30-year-old female patient receiving isotretinoin for severe acne is concerned about taking the medication due to potential side effects. Which of the following counseling points should be prioritized regarding her treatment?",
    options: [
      "It is safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy.",
      "Regular liver function tests are not necessary while on isotretinoin.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Isotretinoin commonly causes dry skin and mucous membranes and patients should be counseled about this to manage side effects proactively. It's also crucial to stress the importance of pregnancy testing due to the high teratogenic risk.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Focus on significant side effects associated with isotretinoin therapy. What common issues do patients report when starting this medication? Remember that counseling about potential side effects is key to helping patients manage their treatment."
  },
  {
