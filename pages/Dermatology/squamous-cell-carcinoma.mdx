# Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): An Overview

## Introduction

Skin cancers are the most common malignancy in the UK, with an estimated incidence of approximately 70,000 cases, though many go unreported. Skin cancers can be categorized into:

- **Melanoma** (~10%)
- **Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers (NMSC)** (~90%)

Among non-melanoma skin cancers, **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)** is the second most prevalent, following basal cell carcinoma (BCC), representing about **23% of NMSC**. SCCs are malignant tumors of the epidermal keratinocytes, characterized by their local invasiveness. While most SCCs are low-risk and can be cured, some at high-risk sites (such as the ears, lips, and tongue) have a tendency to recur locally or metastasize.

## Diagnosis

SCCs are typically diagnosed through clinical assessment and confirmed by further investigations. They are commonly described as:

- **Warty tumors** on a fleshy base
- Presenting as **persistently scaly or crusty irregular lesions** on an inflamed base which may ulcerate or bleed.

### Common Presentation Locations

SCCs usually appear in areas exposed to the sun, including:

- Ears
- Neck
- Head
- Dorsum of hands
- Can occur in any body part, including the genital area

#### Additional Notes:

- SCCs may be tender or non-tender.

## Risk Factors

The primary risk factor for developing SCCs is **excessive UV exposure**, which damages keratinocyte DNA and can lead to SCC development. Other significant risk factors include:

- **Pre-cancerous Conditions**
  - Actinic keratoses (solar keratoses)
  - Bowen's disease

- **Chronic Inflammation**
  - Burns
  - Chronic ulcers
  - Old wound scars

- **Immunosuppression**
  - Autoimmune conditions
  - Previous organ transplants
  - HIV

- **Genetic Conditions**
  - Xeroderma pigmentosum
  - Albinism

- **Viral Factors**
  - Human papillomavirus associated with Bowen’s disease

## Investigations

A referral to a dermatologist is warranted if SCC is suspected. Diagnosis confirmation typically involves:

- **Biopsy**
  - Excision biopsy for small lesions
  - Incision/punch biopsy for larger lesions

*The biopsy is performed under local anesthesia and results usually take `7-10 days`.* 

## Management (Prescribing)

The treatment of choice for SCC is generally **surgical**, yet pre-cancerous conditions like actinic keratoses and Bowen's disease are managed medically.

### Medical Treatments Include:

- **5-Fluorouracil Cream** (Efudix)
- **Diclofenac Gel** 3%
- **Imiquimod** (Aldara)

*Choice of treatment may depend on patient preference.*

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

Surgical excision remains the preferred treatment for SCC. However, other treatments are also available:

- **Curettage and Cautery**
  - Suitable for shallow tumors and in situ SCCs, or palliative care
- **Cryotherapy**
  - Effective for small, shallow, and in situ SCCs
- **Radiotherapy**
  - Indicated for frail and elderly patients or non-resectable tumors

### Follow-Up Care

- **Low-Risk Tumors:** Follow-up every 3 months; patients can be discharged if no recurrence signs.
- **High-Risk Tumors:** Follow-up for a minimum of 2 years every 3 months.

#### Safety-Netting

All patients should be educated on warning signs to watch for and advised when to visit their GP/dermatologist.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 63-year-old male patient with a history of chronic sun exposure presents to the clinic with a scaly, crusted lesion on his ear that has been growing for the past few months. Upon examination, the lesion is tender and has occasional bleeding. Which of the following findings would most likely confirm a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)?",
    options: [
      "Presence of keratin pearls on histology",
      "Infiltration of lymphocytes on histology",
      "Presence of atypical melanocytes on histology",
      "Cytological atypia with dyskeratosis of keratinocytes",
      "Absence of DNA damage markers"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of keratin pearls on histology is a characteristic feature of squamous cell carcinoma and confirms the diagnosis. SCC arises from keratinocytes, and keratin pearls indicate the tumor's differentiation. Other options may relate to different skin conditions or malignancies.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the cellular makeup of SCC. What is a key histological feature that specifically indicates squamous differentiation? Keratin pearls are distinctly associated with keratinocyte tumors."
  },
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old woman presents with a persistent scaly patch on her forehead. A biopsy shows atypical keratinocytes confined to the epidermis. This lesion is most consistent with which of the following diagnoses?",
    options: [
      "Basal Cell Carcinoma",
      "Squamous Cell Carcinoma in situ",
      "Actinic Keratosis",
      "Bowen's Disease",
      "Seborrheic Keratosis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This presentation is consistent with Bowen's disease, which is a form of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. The atypical keratinocytes are confined to the epidermis, and if untreated, it can progress to invasive SCC.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the histological findings and the nature of the atypical keratinocytes. Are they penetrating deeper into the skin layers, or are they confined? What does that imply about the diagnosis?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 70-year-old male with a history of organ transplantation presents with a new crusty lesion on his scalp. Given his immunosuppressed status, which of the following is he at the highest risk for developing?",
    options: [
      "Basal Cell Carcinoma",
      "Melanoma",
      "Actinic Keratosis",
      "Squamous Cell Carcinoma",
      "Seborrheic Keratosis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Immunosuppressed patients, especially those who have undergone organ transplants, are at an increased risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma due to both UV exposure and impaired immune surveillance.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the implications of immunosuppression on skin cancer risk. Which type of skin cancer is specifically associated with increased UV exposure and known to have a significantly higher incidence in immunocompromised patients?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma on the lip undergoes surgical excision. Which of the following factors is MOST important in determining the need for adjuvant therapy post-surgery?",
    options: [
      "Size of the tumor",
      "Location of the tumor",
      "Depth of invasion",
      "Patient’s age",
      "Presence of metastases"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The depth of invasion is a crucial factor in determining the prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma and the need for adjuvant therapy. Deeper invasion often indicates a higher risk for metastasis and recurrence.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which factors are integral to assessing the aggressiveness of SCC. Depth of invasion directly correlates with the likelihood of metastatic potential and subsequent management decisions."
