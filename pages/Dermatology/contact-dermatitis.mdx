# Contact Dermatitis

Contact dermatitis (CD) is a skin reaction caused by contact with an external irritant. It can result from an irritant that an individual has been exposed to before, known as **prior sensitisation**, or can occur with a novel exposure. The two main subtypes of contact dermatitis are **irritant contact dermatitis (ICD)** and **allergic contact dermatitis (ACD)**. 

## Types of Contact Dermatitis

- **Irritant Contact Dermatitis (ICD)**
  - Does not require prior sensitisation 
  - More common than ACD
- **Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD)**
  - A delayed reaction (i.e., a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction)

### **Diagnosis**

Diagnosis of contact dermatitis typically relies on the **history provided by the patient** and clinical examination. Key elements to consider include:

- **Occupational and social history**
- **Previous episodes of dermatitis** 

#### Signs and Symptoms

Signs and symptoms of contact dermatitis include:

- Pruritus 
- Burning 
- Swelling 
- Erythema 
- Hyperpigmentation 
- Scaling 
- Fissuring 

**Note:** Symptoms are usually confined to one specific area—the area that was in contact with the irritant—providing clues regarding the causative agent.

#### Risk Factors

The following risk factors may predispose individuals to contact dermatitis:

- Occupations with frequent exposure to water or chemicals 
- History of atopic dermatitis 

### **Investigations**

Investigations help differentiate between ICD and ACD and confirm the diagnosis of contact dermatitis.

1. **Patch Testing**
   - Tests response to specific allergens
   - Can help identify specific allergens or rule out contact dermatitis

2. **Skin Biopsy**
   - Indicated when patch testing is inconclusive 
   - Useful for differentiating multiple inflammatory skin conditions 

### **Management (Prescribing)**

**First-line therapy** for both ICD and ACD includes the use of **topical corticosteroids**.

#### Management of ICD

- Use moisturisers on the affected area as needed.
- Topical corticosteroids should be the lowest effective dose, reserving stronger options for resistant cases.

#### Management of ACD

**Mild and Moderate ACD**

- **2nd line treatment:** Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) - *not for children under 2 years*.
- **3rd line treatment:** Phototherapy utilizing narrowband UVB light.

**Severe ACD**

- **2nd line treatment:** Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone), tapering the dose slowly due to side effects.
- **3rd line treatment:** Phototherapy.
- **4th line treatment:** Immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin and azathioprine - to be used with caution due to potential severe side effects.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

The most critical management advice for all patients is to avoid the allergen causing the reaction. This may be more challenging if the allergen is unknown or relates to occupational exposure.

In instances of occupational exposure, patients should reach out to their workplace's **occupational health team** for strategies to minimize health impacts.

**Caution:** Be aware that long-term corticosteroid use may lead to skin thinning and other side effects.

  {
    question: "A 45-year-old woman presents with a rash on her hands after starting a new job that involves frequent washing with soap and water. The rash is itchy, erythematous, and has areas of fissuring. A patch test is performed, revealing a positive reaction to a common preservative found in soaps. What subtype of contact dermatitis is she most likely experiencing?",
    options: [
      "Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD)",
      "Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD)",
      "Atopic dermatitis",
      "Psoriasis",
      "Nummular dermatitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient is likely experiencing irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) due to repeated exposure to irritants like water and soap, especially given her occupational setting. Unlike allergic contact dermatitis, ICD does not require prior sensitization and can occur upon initial exposure to irritants.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the mechanisms of contact dermatitis: one subtype develops from direct irritation of the skin without the need for prior sensitization, while the other requires prior exposure to a specific allergen. What are the characteristics of irritant contact dermatitis?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old male gardener develops a pruritic rash on his forearms and neck after handling a new type of plant. His symptoms worsen over a few days, and a patch test shows a reaction to a specific plant oil. Which of the following management strategies should be prioritized for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Oral corticosteroids",
      "Topical calcineurin inhibitors",
      "Avoidance of the triggering plant",
      "Narrowband UVB phototherapy",
      "High-potency topical corticosteroids"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Avoidance of the allergen causing the allergic contact dermatitis is crucial for management. This gardener should be educated to avoid handling the specific plant responsible for his symptoms to prevent future reactions.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the importance of identifying and avoiding triggers in the management of allergic contact dermatitis. What steps can be taken to ensure the patient does not encounter the allergen again?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 60-year-old woman presents with a history of eczema and now shows signs of a new rash on her forearms and neck after using a new skincare product. A patch test is ordered and shows a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a common fragrance component. What is the mechanism underlying her condition?",
    options: [
      "Type 1 hypersensitivity",
      "Type 2 hypersensitivity",
      "Type 3 hypersensitivity",
      "Type 4 hypersensitivity",
      "Autoimmune reaction"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient's condition is likely due to a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction, characteristic of allergic contact dermatitis. This type of hypersensitivity is delayed and involves T-cell mediated immune responses.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the various types of hypersensitivity reactions. Which type is typically associated with delayed onset symptoms and is mediated by T cells rather than antibodies? Keep in mind how this relates to her skin condition."

  {
    question: "A 50-year-old nurse presents with dermatitis on her hands, attributed to frequent hand washing and use of gloves. Physical examination reveals erythema and scaling. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line therapeutic option for this patient’s irritant contact dermatitis?",
    options: [
      "High-potency topical corticosteroids",
      "Moisturizers",
      "Oral corticosteroids",
      "Tacrolimus ointment",
      "UV phototherapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The first-line therapy for irritant contact dermatitis often involves the use of topical corticosteroids; however, moisturizers are also a crucial part of management. In acute scenarios with significant symptoms, a corticosteroid can provide rapid relief.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which treatments are effective in addressing symptoms of irritant contact dermatitis. What role do moisturizers play alongside corticosteroids, and when are stronger therapies warranted in treatment?"
