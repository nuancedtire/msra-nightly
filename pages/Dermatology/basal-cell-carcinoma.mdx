# Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the **most common skin cancer** in the UK. It is more prevalent in men and individuals with a **fair complexion**. BCC is classified as a **locally invasive cancer** that rarely metastasizes. It can present on any part of the body but is most commonly found in sun-exposed areas.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of BCC is **histological**, but obtaining a thorough patient history is crucial.

### Risk Factors

A range of risk factors is associated with developing a BCC:

- **UV light exposure**
- **Sun exposure**
- **X-ray exposure**
- **Arsenic exposure**
- **Xeroderma pigmentosum:** A rare inherited condition that significantly increases sensitivity to sunlight.
- **Basal cell naevus syndrome:** A rare inherited condition leading to multiple and early-onset BCCs, increasing the risk of various cancers.

### Skin Examination

- A comprehensive skin examination should be performed if a BCC is suspected:
  - Inspect under sufficient light or use a **dermatoscope**.
- BCCs can manifest in various ways, including:
  - **Papules with telangiectasia** (most common presentation)
  - **Rolled borders** around plaques or tumors
  - **Non-healing wounds**
  - **Pearly papules or plaques**
- The **stretch test** can assist in identifying BCC: when the skin surrounding the lesion is stretched, the tumor becomes well-defined with pearly edges.

## Investigations

Diagnosis requires **confirmation by histopathology**.

### Skin Biopsy

- A skin biopsy can be performed as:
  - **Shave biopsy**
  - **Punch biopsy** (if the tumor is well-defined and less than `10mm`)

### Histological Features

- Under the microscope, BCC cells appear:
  - **Large and hyperchromatic**
  - Containing oval-shaped nuclei with minimal cytoplasm
  - Surrounded by a **hypercellular stroma** separated from neoplastic cells by clefts.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Excisional surgery**: The first-line treatment for BCC is surgery, with a standard full-thickness excision curing `90%` of cases, although this is best suited for non-cosmetically challenging areas.
  
- **Mohs surgery**: Recommended for patients resistant to conventional surgery or for BCCs in cosmetically sensitive regions (e.g., the face). This technique involves progressive removal of cancerous tissue until tumor-free tissue remains, preserving maximal surrounding tissue.

- **Radiotherapy**: An option for patients reluctant to undergo surgery, especially in older patients, though it may have inferior long-term cosmetic outcomes compared to surgery.

- **Cryotherapy**: Utilizes liquid nitrogen to freeze the tumor, leading to cell death and the generation of new healthy tissue. Best suited for superficial BCCs.

- **Topical treatments**: Options include **Imiquimod** and **fluorouracil** for treating BCC.

**Warning:** Regular skin examinations and awareness of new lesions or changes are crucial for early detection of BCC.

  {
    question: "Which of the following is the most common presentation of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)?",
    options: [
      "Non-healing wound",
      "Rolled border tumors",
      "Pearly papules or plaques",
      "Papules with telangiectasia",
      "Superficial scaling lesions"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The most common presentation of BCC is papules with telangiectasia. These lesions are often found on sun-exposed areas and typically have a pearly appearance. Recognizing this specific presentation is key for early detection and treatment.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the common characteristics of BCC. Think about the typical lesion appearance that patients present within clinical settings, particularly those most frequently associated with this type of skin cancer."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary mechanism of action of Imiquimod in the treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma?",
    options: [
      "Inducing apoptosis in tumor cells",
      "Blocking angiogenesis",
      "Stimulating immune response",
      "Inhibiting DNA synthesis",
      "Altering the tumor microenvironment"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Imiquimod acts as an immune response modifier. It stimulates the local immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, aiding in the treatment of superficial BCCs.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Revisit the pharmacological profile of Imiquimod. Focus on how this topical agent interacts with the immune system and the mechanism by which it helps to eradicate superficial tumors."
  },
  {
    question: "A 58-year-old man is diagnosed with a basal cell carcinoma on his face. Which treatment option would be most appropriate for preserving cosmetic appearance while ensuring complete excision of the tumor?",
    options: [
      "Excisional surgery",
      "Mohs surgery",
      "Radiotherapy",
      "Cryotherapy",
      "Topical fluorouracil"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Mohs surgery is the preferred treatment in cosmetically sensitive areas like the face, as it allows for complete excision of cancerous tissue while sparing as much surrounding healthy tissue as possible.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the surgical techniques used for skin cancers and their implications for cosmetic outcomes. Remember, the goal is to minimize scarring while ensuring complete tumor removal."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following risk factors is associated with an increased likelihood of developing Basal Cell Carcinoma?",
    options: [
      "Type 1 diabetes",
      "Cigarette smoking",
      "Chronic UV light exposure",
      "Obesity",
      "Chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Chronic UV light exposure is a well-established risk factor for developing BCC. Frequent exposure to sunlight without adequate protection increases the risk of skin mutations leading to cancer.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the environmental and lifestyle factors that influence skin cancer risk. Focus on the link between UV exposure and skin carcinogenesis."
