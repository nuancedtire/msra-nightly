# Melanoma: Overview and Management

Melanoma is a **malignant neoplasm** of melanocytes. Its incidence is on the rise, and it unfortunately has the highest mortality among all skin neoplasms.

## Subtypes of Melanoma

There are four main subtypes:

1. **Superficial Spreading Melanoma** 
   - Presents as a plaque with irregular borders and variegated color.
  
2. **Lentigo Maligna Melanoma**
   - A tan/brown macule that enlarges gradually to a papule/nodule.
  
3. **Acral Lentiginous Melanoma**
   - Arises on palms, soles, subungual, and mucosal surfaces.
  
4. **Nodular Melanoma**
   - A darkly pigmented nodule, sometimes ulcerated.

Other rare variants include nevoid melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma, and solitary dermal melanoma.

### Risk Factors for Melanoma

The majority of melanomas arise de novo, but some arise from **precursors** associated with dysplastic and congenital melanocytic naevi. Risk factors for developing melanoma are:

- **Genetic** 
  - Family history of melanoma or dysplastic naevi.
  
- **Environmental** 
  - Sun and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure habits, including a history of sunburns.
  
- **Phenotypic** 
  - Skin types I and II (light/fair-skinned).
  - >50 common naevi.
  - Atypical naevi (dysplastic, congenital).
  - Personal history of melanoma.

## Signs of Malignancy

Signs of malignancy follow the **ABCDE rule**:

- **A**: Asymmetry in shape.
- **B**: Border is irregular.
- **C**: Color is not uniform / variegated / mottled.
- **D**: Diameter is large (`≥6mm`).
- **E**: Elevation is present and irregular or **E**volution (e.g., enlarging, ulceration, bleeding, pigmentation).

The "ugly duckling" sign is an important finding that describes a skin lesion that looks different from other surrounding lesions and should raise suspicions of melanoma.

### Disease Progression

The spread of the disease usually occurs in a stepwise sequence: 
- **Primary melanoma** → **Regional metastases** → **Distant metastases**. 

Regional metastases appear as a dermal nodule or plaque-like lesion, often close in proximity to the primary tumor. Distant metastases occur anywhere but often in the lungs, liver, brain, bone, and intestines.

## Differential Diagnosis

Differentials that mimic melanoma include:

- **Benign**:
  - Common melanocytic naevus
  - Atypical melanocytic naevus
  - Traumatized naevus
  - Blue naevus
  - Lentigo (ink spot)
  - Spitz naevus
  - Seborrheic keratosis
  - Pyogenic granuloma
  - Cherry hemangioma
  - Dermatofibroma
  - Subungual hematoma (for acral lentiginous melanoma)

- **Malignant and Pre-malignant**:
  - Pigmented basal cell carcinoma
  - Pigmented actinic keratosis
  - Keratoacanthoma

## Prognostic Features

Prognostic features include:

- **Tumor thickness** – the single most important factor for localized melanoma.
- **Histologic findings** of ulceration and mitotic rate.
- **Presence of regional or distant metastases**.

## Diagnosis

A biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis of melanoma. Features to be determined histopathologically include:

- Architectural
- Cytologic
- Host response

These provide diagnostic and prognostic information that influence the selection of treatment for patients with melanoma. Immunochemistry may be helpful in difficult cases or in nodal metastases to guide treatment.

## Investigations

Referral to a dermatologist is warranted for further evaluation. Experienced professionals should perform dermoscopy to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis of melanoma.

Ideally, a complete full-thickness excision biopsy (with `1 to 3mm` margin of normal-looking skin and part of subcutaneous fat) of the most raised/darkest area should be performed to confirm the histological diagnosis of melanoma. When performing an excision biopsy, refer to a dermatological surgeon or plastic surgeon for cosmetic removal of facial lesions due to the high risk of medicolegal claims in this area of practice if there is a poor cosmetic outcome.

### Management (Prescribing)

None recommended.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

Upon diagnosis of melanoma, wide local excision with adequate margins is the only curative treatment. The recommended width of the resection margin varies with the location of the melanoma:

- For melanoma of the trunk and extremities, margins range from `0.5 to 2cm`, based on the thickness of the primary tumor.
  
- For head and neck area, if similar principles cannot be applied, **adjuvant radiation therapy** may be indicated, particularly if the lesion is considered to be of high recurrence risk.
  
- For subungual, plantar/palmar sites or mucous membranes, the optimal surgical approach is currently controversial, but these melanomas are generally associated with a worse prognosis.

In cases of metastases, patients with **oligometastatic disease** (i.e., limited to one or a limited number of sites) should be evaluated for possible definitive metastasectomy and adjuvant systemic therapy. If surgical metastasectomy is not appropriate, systemic therapy should be offered.

Melanoma may have a late recurrence, usually more than `10 years`; thus, long-term follow-up is required.

### Prevention and Screening

In terms of primary prevention, all patients should be educated about the importance of **sun protection**. This includes:

- Minimizing sun exposure.
- Using sun-protective clothing.
- Applying sunscreen (with sun protective factor [SPF] of at least `30`).
- Avoiding tanning beds.

However, *routine screening for the general population is not currently recommended*. Only in the presence of high-risk factors (e.g., strong family history, personal history of multiple naevi), screening in the form of annual full-body skin examinations by qualified practitioners should be performed.

  {
    question: "A 55-year-old male presents with a newly noticed dark nodule on his back, which has irregular borders and multiple colors. According to the ABCDE mnemonic, which characteristic most strongly suggests that this lesion may be malignant?",
    options: [
      "A: Elevation of the lesion",
      "B: Asymmetry in shape",
      "C: Diameter greater than 6 mm",
      "D: Color uniformity",
      "E: Border regularity"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The asymmetry in shape (A) indicates a potential malignancy and is a crucial feature in the ABCDE rule for recognizing melanoma. Malignant lesions tend to have irregular shapes when split in half.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the criteria used to assess the potential severity of skin lesions. What does asymmetrical shape indicate compared to other characteristics like uniformity or regular borders?"
