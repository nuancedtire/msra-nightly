# Lichen Planus: A Comprehensive Overview

Lichen planus is a fairly common (affecting about 1 in 100 people worldwide) itchy, non-contagious rash that occurs in adults usually between 30 and 60 years of age. It is a **chronic inflammatory disease** affecting the skin, as well as hair, nails, and mucous membranes.

## Characteristics of Lichen Planus

A typical eruption of the rash is an itchy, shiny, and flat-topped purple papule or plaque. It occurs when activated T-lymphocytes migrate to dermal-epidermal junctions and cause apoptosis of keratinocytes. There are **no clear causes**, but it is thought to be **autoimmune** as well as being associated with hepatitis C infection due to changed cytokine expression. Hepatitis C is associated more with oral disease than cutaneous. Some medications are linked with the onset of lichen planus.

### Natural Course

Lichen planus is **self-limiting** and does not require routine monitoring. However, specific cases warrant attention:

- **Erosive oral and genital lichen planus**: Requires monitoring due to a risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma.
- **Scalp involvement**: Can lead to scarring alopecia.

Over **50% of patients** with cutaneous disease have lesions that resolve within `6 months`, and **85%** resolve within `18 months`. Oral lichen planus can persist for an average of `5 years`.

<summary>Common Signs and Symptoms</summary>

- **Cutaneous Lesions**:
  - Pruritic, violaceous, polygonal papules or plaques.
  - Wickham's striae (a white lace-like pattern).

- **Oral Involvement**:
  - Painful erosions/ulcerations.
  - White striae and purple plaques or papules.

- **Nail Changes**:
  - Thinning of the nail palate.
  - Longitudinal ridging.

- **Scalp Changes**:
  - Keratocyte plugs causing perifollicular inflammation.

## Diagnosis

Lichen planus (LP) is primarily a **clinical diagnosis** based on history and examination findings. 

### Key Aspects for Diagnosis

- **History**: Ascertain any risk factors, such as:
  - Hepatitis C infection
  - Psychosocial stress
  - Contact allergies
  - Newly initiated medications (e.g., anti-malarials, thiazide diuretics, NSAIDs, ÃŸ-blockers, penicillamine)

- **Lesion Development**:
  - Insidious growth with maximal spreading occurring between `2-16 weeks`.

### Investigations

The characteristic examination findings are often sufficient for diagnosis, but the following investigations may be considered:

| **Investigation**           | **Purpose**                                                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Histopathology              | Establish a diagnosis if difficult; identify lymphocytic infiltrate and necrotic keratinocytes. |
| Direct immunofluorescent staining | Shows deposits of immunoglobulins at the base of the epidermis.  |
| Patch testing               | For suspected contact allergies, especially in oral LP.     |
| Hepatitis C testing         | Higher incidence of oral LP in patients with HCV.           |

## Management of Lichen Planus

### Prescribing

- In **mild cases**: Potent topical corticosteroids are first-line.
- For **hypertrophic lesions**: Consider intralesional corticosteroids.
- In **severe cases**: Treat with oral corticosteroids for `2-6 weeks`, gradually tapering over several weeks.
  
#### Additional Treatments
- **Topical Retinoids**: If corticosteroids are ineffective.
- **Anti-histamines**: (e.g., loratadine) for symptomatic itch relief.
- **Ulcerative Oral LP**: Treat with topical corticosteroids.

### Non-Prescribing

- If **asymptomatic and non-ulcerative**: Does not require treatment.
- If **symptomatic**: Consider barrier agents or topical anesthetic mouth rinse/gel (e.g., benzydamine).
- **Widespread lichen planus**: May respond to UV-B therapy.

<summary>Risk Factors for Treatment Resistance</summary>

- Chronic stress
- Coexisting medical conditions
- Exposure to aggravating drugs or allergens

  {
    question: "A 45-year-old woman presents with a pruritic purple rash on her wrists and ankles, accompanied by painful oral ulcers. Upon examination, you note Wickham's striae. A biopsy reveals a dense band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Psoriasis",
      "Lichen simplex chronicus",
      "Lichen planus",
      "Seborrheic dermatitis",
      "Nummular eczema"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the clinical presentation of pruritic purple papules with Wickham's striae, along with the biopsy findings, lichen planus is the most likely diagnosis. This disease is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate and specific histopathological features. The other options do not match this clinical picture.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the key signs and symptoms of lichen planus, particularly the characteristic rash and histopathological findings. Consider how these findings differ from those seen in other dermatological conditions."
  },

    question: "Which of the following is considered a significant risk factor for the development of oral lichen planus in patients?",
    options: [
      "Use of topical corticosteroids",
      "Recent history of allergic rhinitis",
      "Hepatitis C infection",
      "Repeated recreational tanning",
      "Family history of eczema"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Hepatitis C infection is a known risk factor for the development of oral lichen planus, often associated with more severe oral manifestations. The other options are less relevant to the etiology of lichen planus.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the association between systemic conditions and lichen planus. Review how certain viral infections are known to influence the development of this condition compared to other factors."
  },

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In cases of hypertrophic lichen planus, potent topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment to reduce inflammation and pruritus. Oral corticosteroids are generally reserved for more severe cases. The other options may not be appropriate first-line treatments.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the typical management strategies for different severities of lichen planus. How do treatments differ based on the type and site of lesions? Consider what is preferred for addressing localized inflammatory responses."
  },
