# Nail Changes: Causes and Implications

Nail changes can be indicative of various underlying health conditions. This article outlines notable **nail abnormalities**, their potential causes, and associated systemic disorders.

## Common Nail Changes and Their Causes

The following table summarizes various types of nail changes along with their potential causes:

| **Nail Change**                             | **Possible Causes**                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pitting, Onycholysis, Subungual Hyperkeratosis | Psoriasis                                                             |
| Lateral Thinning of Nail Plate, Longitudinal Ridging | Lichen Planus                                                       |
| Splinter Haemorrhages                       | Infective Endocarditis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Rheumatoid Arthritis |
| Half-and-Half Nails (Lindsay's Nails)      | Chronic Renal Failure                                                  |
| Koilonychia                                 | Iron Deficiency Anaemia                                               |
| Leukonychia                                 | Hypoalbuminaemia                                                      |
| Clubbing                                    | Bronchial Carcinoma, Tuberculosis, Cystic Fibrosis, Infective Endocarditis |
| Beau's Lines                                | Any systemic illness affecting the growth of the nail matrix           |

<summary>Detailed Causes of Nail Changes</summary>

- **Psoriasis**
  - Frequently characterized by pitting, onycholysis, and subungual hyperkeratosis.

- **Lichen Planus**
  - Notable for lateral thinning of the nail plate and longitudinal ridging.

- **Splinter Haemorrhages**
  - Small, linear, dark red or brown streaks under the nails, associated with conditions such as infective endocarditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Chronic Renal Failure**
  - Associated with Half-and-Half Nails, where the proximal half of the nail is white and the distal half is pink or red.

- **Iron Deficiency Anaemia**
  - Presents as koilonychia, where nails become thin and spoon-shaped.

- **Hypoalbuminaemia**
  - Characterized by leukonychia, with white discolored nails due to low albumin levels.

- **Clubbing**
  - Typically seen in advanced lung diseases like bronchial carcinoma and cystic fibrosis.

- **Beau's Lines**
  - Indicate a temporary cessation of nail growth often due to systemic illness or traumatic events.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Pitting and subungual hyperkeratosis are classic nail changes associated with psoriasis, a common autoimmune disorder. It’s important to consider the systemic implications of these changes, especially given her family history.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which nail changes are specifically mentioned in the article as indicative of certain conditions. Psoriasis is highlighted as one of the key causes of pitting and subungual hyperkeratosis."

      "Psoriasis",
      "Lichen Planus",
      "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Lateral thinning of the nail plate and longitudinal ridging are characteristic of lichen planus, which can present with these nail abnormalities. Identifying these specific changes can aid in diagnosing underlying conditions.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the distinct nail changes listed in the article. Which of these conditions is associated specifically with lateral thinning and longitudinal ridging? Understanding the specifics can help guide your answer."

    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Nail clubbing is commonly associated with conditions like bronchial carcinoma and tuberculosis, particularly in the context of respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and weight loss.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the nail change observed (clubbing) and the associated systemic conditions highlighted in the article. Conditions linked to clubbing often have significant respiratory involvement; consider the patient symptoms and which condition aligns."
