# Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP)

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP), also known as **IgA Vasculitis**, is a systemic, immune-mediated vasculitis of the small blood vessels. It primarily affects the skin, kidneys, bowels, and joints, often following throat infections or gastroenteritis. Most patients with HSP make a full recovery; however, it may lead to **Henoch-Schönlein nephritis**, making timely treatment crucial to prevent long-term kidney damage.

## Diagnosis

HSP most commonly affects children under the age of 5, but it can also occur in adults of all ages. Its incidence is approximately `10-20/100,000`.

### Common Symptoms

- **Skin Rashes**: Palpable purpura
- **Joint Pain** and swelling
- **Abdominal Pain**
- **Nausea** and vomiting

### Less Common, Severe Symptoms

- **Bloody Urine** (Haematuria)
- **Foamy Urine** (Proteinuria)
- **Hypertension**
- Appendicitis
- High blood pressure
- Skin ulcers
- Gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage
- Pancreatitis
- Swelling of the testicles
- Intussusception

The diagnosis is made by recognizing a typical pattern of symptoms, with 100% of patients presenting with the classical **skin rash**. This rash usually appears symmetrically on the lower limbs and buttocks and may also affect the face, ears, and arms. The rash feels like small bumps (palpable) and exhibits a red/purple color (purpura).

To confirm HSP, patients must have:

- **Palpable Purpura**
  
And at least one of the following:

- **Renal Involvement**: Haematuria and/or proteinuria
- **Arthritis/Arthralgia**: Acute onset
- **Abdominal Pain**: Diffuse
- **IgA Antibodies**: Present in skin, bowel, or kidney biopsy

## Investigations

- Normal haemoglobin (may be low due to bleeding), normal/elevated CRP, normal MCV, and thrombocytes
- Urine sample to detect possible kidney damage (haematuria or proteinuria)
- Throat swab for potential streptococcus infection
- Antibody Testing:
  - `50-70%` of patients show elevated IgA and IgM in acute stage
  - IgA deposits in biopsy
- Biopsies:
  - **Skin Biopsy**: Shows leucocytoclastic vasculitis
  - **Kidney Biopsy**: Exhibits changes ranging from focal and segmental glomerulonephritis to severe extracapillary proliferation
- Imaging:
  - **CT Scan** or abdominal ultrasound for bowel involvement, showing bowel inflammation

> A negative biopsy does not exclude the diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura.

## Management (Prescribing)

In most cases, HSP requires no specific treatment, as the majority of patients experience spontaneous remission within `2-4 weeks`. Treatments may include:

- **Symptomatic Relief**: Simple analgesia (e.g., paracetamol)
- **NSAIDs**: For joint or abdominal pain (avoid in renal involvement)
- **Steroids (e.g., Prednisolone)**: For severe joint or abdominal pain
- **Skin Manifestations**: Generally self-managed, but severe cases may require:
  - Colchicine
  - Dapsone
- **Renal and Severe Bowel Symptoms**: May necessitate immunosuppressants (e.g., Cytoxan) alongside steroids
- **Hypertension Management**: Blood pressure-lowering medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors, ARBs)

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

Progressive renal involvement may require plasmapheresis, while acute abdominal pain might necessitate surgical intervention. Patients should be advised that:

- **Bed rest**: Beneficial for reducing illness progression
- **Activity Levels**: Increased activity can lead to recurrence of HSP

    question: "A 4-year-old boy presents with a history of rash, abdominal pain, and joint swelling following a recent respiratory infection. On examination, he has palpable purpura on his lower limbs and buttocks. A urine analysis reveals haematuria and proteinuria. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Kawasaki Disease",
      "Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP)",
      "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus",
      "Autoimmune Vasculitis",
      "Scabies"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presentation of palpable purpura, abdominal pain, joint swelling, and renal involvement in a child following a respiratory infection is consistent with Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP), which is an IgA vasculitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the symptoms presented: palpable purpura after a recent infection alongside abdominal pain and joint involvement. Which condition fits this profile the best in pediatric patients?"
  },
  {
    question: "During the management of a patient diagnosed with Henoch-Schönlein Purpura, which of the following treatments should be avoided if the patient shows signs of renal involvement?",
    options: [
      "Corticosteroids",
      "NSAIDs",
      "Simple analgesia",
      "Immunosuppressants",
      "Antihypertensive medications"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! NSAIDs should be avoided in cases of renal involvement due to the potential risk of worsening renal function and causing further damage.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the implications of administering medications in a patient with renal issues. Which class of drugs might exacerbate renal dysfunction in the context of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 7-year-old girl is diagnosed with HSP. Which of the following laboratory findings would most likely support the diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Elevated carbamide nitrogen (BUN)",

      "Positive ANA",
      "Elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK)",
      "Presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Elevated IgA and IgM antibodies are commonly observed in acute HSP and help support the diagnosis alongside clinical features.",
    incorrectFeedback: "What does the presence of elevated IgA or IgM indicate in the context of HSP? Recall the specific immune components that are characteristic of this condition."
  },
  {
    question: "While educating the parents of a child with HSP about the prognosis, which of the following statements is true?",
