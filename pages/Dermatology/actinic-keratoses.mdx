# Actinic Keratosis: Diagnosis and Management

Actinic keratoses (AK), also known as solar or senile keratoses, are **scaly skin lesions** that develop on **sun-damaged skin** and are considered **premalignant lesions**. They have the potential to progress into **squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs)**, necessitating appropriate medical or surgical intervention.

## Diagnosis

AK are primarily caused by **cumulative sun exposure**, typically located on **sun-exposed areas** such as:

- Hands
- Face
- Balding scalp

They often present as multiple AK alongside other signs of **photoaging**. 

### Risk Factors

A variety of factors increase the likelihood of developing AK, including:

- **Old age** (hence the term 'senile keratoses')
- Fitzpatrick skin types **I–III** (i.e., fair skin, hair, eyes)
- History of **sunburn**, especially during childhood
- **Immunocompromised states**
- Residency in **tropical countries**
- **Outdoor occupation or hobby**

AK are usually diagnosed clinically and classified based on the lesion's appearance during examination, ideally using a **dermatoscope**.

#### Table 1: Classification of Lesions

| **Grade**          | **Characteristics**                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Mild grade**     | Just visible macules and papules                    |
|                    | Pink or grey colored; crusty or scaly               |
| **Moderate grade** | Red patches or plaques                               |
|                    | Scaly, with a ‘sandpaper-like texture’              |
| **Severe grade**   | Thick hyperkeratotic                                |
|                    | Resembles early squamous cell carcinoma              |
| **Field change**   | Confluent lesions                                   |
|                    | Any grade                                           |

## Investigations

Investigation of AK is warranted only if **early SCC** or other skin cancers are suspected. In such cases, a **biopsy** of the lesion should be obtained for histological analysis.

## Management (Prescribing)

Treatment of AK is necessary because of their potential to evolve into an SCC. **Topical medical treatments** are especially useful for multiple AK, typically requiring multiple daily applications for **2 to 16 weeks**. Common treatments include:

- **Topical**
  - `Fluorouracil (5-FU, Efudix)`
  - `Imiquimod`
  - `Diclofenac sodium gel`

**Warning:** Inform patients that these treatments may cause significant skin inflammation.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

In addition to topical treatments, AK can be treated using various **medical or surgical procedures**, such as:

- **Procedures**
  - `Cryosurgery`
  - `Photodynamic therapy`
- **Surgical Options**
  - `Shave excision & curettage`
  - `Excision`
  - `Dermabrasion`

All patients should receive **advice on skin protection from the sun**.

    question: "A 72-year-old male presents with several scaly lesions on his bald scalp, face, and hands. He has a history of multiple sunburns in his youth and an outdoor occupation. Upon examination, the lesions are slightly crusty and pink in color. What grade of actinic keratosis do these lesions most likely represent?",
    options: [
      "Mild grade",
      "Moderate grade",
      "Severe grade",
      "Field change",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The description of slightly crusty and pink lesions aligns with mild-grade actinic keratosis, which usually consists of just visible macules and papules. The history of sun exposure further supports this diagnosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the characteristics described in the article. Mild-grade lesions are generally pink or grey and crusty or scaly but not as advanced as moderate or severe grades. Review the criteria for each grade of actinic keratosis."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following treatments is NOT typically used for actinic keratosis?",
    options: [
      "Fluorouracil (5-FU)",
      "Imiquimod",
      "Cryosurgery",
      "Photodynamic therapy",
      "Topical corticosteroids"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Topical corticosteroids are not used to treat actinic keratosis. The other options listed are standard treatments for managing actinic keratosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reconsider the treatments mentioned for actinic keratosis. What role do corticosteroids play in dermatological treatment? Look back at the article for the specific topical treatments outlined."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient presents with actinic keratosis and expresses concern about the treatments prescribed to him. He mentions hearing that they could cause significant skin inflammation. Which treatment should be emphasized to the patient as potentially causing this side effect?",

      "Diclofenac sodium gel",
      "Cryosurgery",
      "Fluorouracil (5-FU)",
      "Shave excision",
      "Dermabrasion"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Fluorouracil (5-FU) is known to cause significant inflammation as a side effect. It's important to inform patients about this effect to prepare them for the treatment process.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the side effects mentioned in the article regarding topical treatments. Fluorouracil is specifically noted for causing significant skin inflammation. Which other treatments might cause less irritation?"
  },
  {
