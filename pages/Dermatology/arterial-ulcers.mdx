# Arterial Ulcers: Diagnosis and Management

An **ulcer** is a disruption to the surface of the skin’s epithelium. An *arterial ulcer* (also known as an ischaemic ulcer) arises due to inadequate tissue perfusion resulting from reduced blood flow to the region. These ulcers commonly affect the **legs** and **feet** and often stem from conditions such as **atherosclerosis** in **peripheral arterial disease (PAD)**. If left untreated, they may result in serious complications, including infection, gangrene, tissue necrosis, and, in severe cases, amputation.

## Diagnosis

### Epidemiology

- Arterial ulcers account for approximately **2%** of leg ulcers.
- **Venous ulcers** constitute around **70%** of leg ulcers.
- Mixed arterial and venous diseases make up the remaining **15%**.

### Risk Factors

- **Hypertension** and **hypercholesterolemia**
- **Smoking**
- **Diabetes Mellitus**
- **Increasing age**
- **Positive family history**

### Aetiology

Specific causes of arterial ulcers include:

- **Atherosclerosis** (Peripheral Vascular Disease)
- **Embolic disease**
- **Diabetes mellitus**
- **Heart** and **renal failure**
- **Vasculitic disease**
- **Vasospasms**
- **Rheumatoid arthritis** (results in vasculitis)
- **Pressure application** (causes arterio-occlusion)

The **Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire** is a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for *lower extremity arterial disease*.

### Signs & Symptoms of Ischaemic Ulcers

#### Signs

- Located on pressure points:
  - Lateral malleolus
  - Heel
  - Between toes (peripheral portions of limbs)
- Ulcer appearance:
  - Generally symmetrical with well-demarcated borders
  - Punched-out nature with a necrotic base
- Surrounding skin:
  - Shiny with hair loss
- **Pulselessness**: Feet may feel cold

#### Symptoms

Key features include:

- **Painful burning sensation**:
  - Worsens at night; patients often report relief from hanging feet over the bed or walking on colder surfaces.
- **Intermittent claudication**:
  - Aching or cramping pain upon exertion in the affected limb, relieved by rest (typically occurs when ABPI is `0.6-0.9`).
- **Pain on rest**:
  - No exertion is required; occurs when ABPI is `0.3-0.6`.

**TIP**: Remember the general characteristics of *Peripheral Vascular Disease* using the 6P’s:

- **Painful**
- **Pallor**
- **Pulseless**
- **Paraesthesia** (loss of sensation)
- **Paralysis**
- **Poikilothermia** (cold extremities)

### Complications

Continuous exposure of the wound to external environments increases the risk of:

- **Bacterial infections** and systemic sepsis
- **Gangrene**
- **Peripheral nerve damage** (paralysis & paraesthesia)
- **Amputation**

## Investigations

### Bedside Investigations & Physical Examination

1. **Capillary Refill Time**: Prolonged CRT (`> 2 seconds`) indicates arterial insufficiency.
2. **Buerger Test**: Elevating the limb causes it to turn pale; restoration of color upon lowering indicates arterial responsivity. A delay of `> 10-15 seconds` indicates insufficiency.
3. **Ankle Brachial Pulse Index (ABPI)**:
   - Ratios indicate severity of peripheral vascular disease:
     - ABPI `> 1.2`: Indicates calcification in vessels.
     - ABPI `< 0.9`: Indicative of Peripheral Arterial Disease.
     - ABPI `< 0.5`: Indicates Critical Limb Ischaemia.
     - ABPI `< 0.3`: More likely to present with ulceration and gangrene.
4. **Urine Dipstick**: To assess for glycosuria (diabetes).
5. **Swabs**: To test for infection.
6. **ECG**: To assess for atrial fibrillation and cardiac issues.

### Blood Tests

1. **FBC**: Identify anaemias and other haemoglobinopathies.
2. **HbA1c**
3. **Lipid levels**: HDL and LDL.
4. **ESR**: Assess for inflammatory causes.
5. **U&Es**: Evaluate renal function.
6. **Auto-antibodies**: Assessment for RA & SLE.

### Imaging

- **1st Line**: **Duplex Ultrasound**
- **2nd Line**: **MRA Angiography** to assess tissue viability for potential plastic surgery.

#### Biopsy

A biopsy may be conducted if malignancy is suspected.

## Management (Prescribing)

**NOTE:** Pharmacological management aims at:

- Addressing causes of arterial ulcers (e.g., PAD, diabetes).
- Modifying cardiovascular risk factors.
- Initiating anti-platelet therapy.

### Management Strategies

#### Vasodilator Therapy for Peripheral Arterial Disease

1. **Naftidrofuryl Oxalate** - 1st line therapy for intermittent claudication.
   - Mechanism: **5-HT2 Receptor Antagonist**
   - Suitable if no benefit from exercise or patient opts out of revascularization.
   
2. **Cilostazol**
   - Mechanism: **Phosphodiesterase III Inhibitor**
   - Not generally recommended due to limited evidence and cost-effectiveness.

#### Pain Management

- **Paracetamol** or opiates, as per pain level in patients with critical limb ischaemia.

### Cardiovascular Risk Factor Modification

1. **Lipid-Lowering Therapy**:
   - **Atorvastatin** target: `< 1.8 mmol/L` or `> 50%` reduction.
   - Higher doses for established cardiac disease.

2. **Anti-hypertensive Therapy**:
   - ACE inhibitors recommended, caution with renal artery stenosis.
   - Beta-blockers are not contraindicated.

3. **Diabetic Control**: Based on diabetes type (T1 or T2).

#### Anti-Platelet Therapy

1. **Clopidogrel** - 1st line for patients with PAD.
   - More effective than aspirin in stroke and myocardial infarction prevention.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

**NOTE:** Non-pharmacological options may include:

- **Wound management**.
- **Exercise training**: 1st line management overall for PAD patients.
- **Revascularisation therapy** (angioplasty or bypass).
- **Amputation**: Considered if other managements fail.

### Wound Management of the Arterial Ulcer

1. Wound debridement and antibiotics if infection is present.
   - Topical antiseptics and antibiotics generally not recommended as they can impede healing.
2. **Compression therapy** is contraindicated in cases of arterial disease.

### Exercise Training

1. **1st line** for all patients with intermittent claudication.
2. **Recommendation**: 2 hours of weekly exercise over 3 months.

### Revascularisation

1. Offered to those with intermittent claudication.
2. Bypass grafts offered if angioplasty fails.

### Amputation

Considered as a last resort if all treatments fail.

### Targeting the Arterial Ulcer Itself

Skin grafts or flaps may be utilized; however, viability often depends on the ulcer's condition.
