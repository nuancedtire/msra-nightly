# Lentigo Maligna and Lentigo Maligna Melanoma

Lentigo maligna is a precursor to, and an early form of, lentigo maligna melanoma. Characterized by atypical proliferation of **melanocytes**, these cells remain confined to the epidermis and are sometimes described as **melanoma in situ**. This condition primarily affects **sun-damaged** areas of the body, especially the face and neck.

## Risk Factors

Total UV exposure is a significant risk factor, making it more prevalent among outdoor workers. Furthermore, other risk factors include:

- **Increased number of melanocytic nevi**
- **Fair skin**
- **History of severe sunburn**

Lentigo maligna can remain present for many years (up to 15 years) before it invades beyond the epidermis and progresses to melanoma. The estimated lifetime risk of developing *lentigo maligna melanoma* from lentigo maligna is approximately `~5%`.

## Diagnosis

Patients with suspected lentigo maligna or lentigo maligna melanoma require a complete physical examination that focuses on the skin and lymph nodes. Existing moles and any new pigmented lesions should be thoroughly inspected using the **A-E rule for melanoma**:

- **A** - Asymmetry
- **B** - Border irregularity 
- **C** - Colour irregularity
- **D** - Diameter >`6mm`
- **E** - Enlargement

Lentigo maligna often presents with a **large size** (i.e., >`6mm`) and can be several centimetres in diameter upon diagnosis. The lesions typically exhibit:

- An **irregular shape**
- **Variable pigmentation** (ranging from brown to pink, red, or even white)
- A **smooth surface**, often described as resembling **ink on skin**.

**All moles should be assessed**, and any suspicious lesions photographed for further evaluation.

## Investigations

Dermoscopy is the first-line investigation for lentigo maligna, though differentiating pigmented lesions—especially on the face—can be challenging. Following dermoscopy, the lesion should be subjected to a **full-thickness punch biopsy** into the subcutaneous fat to assess thickness, which is important for prognosis. 

Alternatively, an **excisional biopsy** can be considered if the lesion is small. For melanoma staging, the **TNM system** is utilized, which assesses:

| Parameter          | Description                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Tumour Size        | Size of the tumour                         |
| Ulceration         | Presence of ulceration                     |
| Number of Mitoses  | Count of mitoses per mm²                  |

*Lentigo melanoma is classified as Tis*, indicating that it is in situ with no extension beyond the epidermis.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

The primary treatment for lentigo maligna is **surgical excision**, with narrow margins of excision (between `0.5cm` and `1cm`) typically sufficient. It is rare for the condition to recur; however, determining the clear borders of the lesion can be complicated by the surrounding sun-damaged skin. For cases where patients are unsuitable for surgery, the following non-surgical options may be considered:

- **Cryotherapy**: Not standard management but suitable for patients unable to undergo surgery. Low temperatures destroy melanocytes while preserving keratinocytes in the skin.
  
- **Topical imiquimod cream**: Effective but requires regular application for clinical clearance, with a risk of recurrence.
  
- **Radiation therapy**: Can be utilized, but accurate mapping of the tumour is essential as underestimation can lead to larger tumours than initially visualized.

**Warning:** Close follow-up is essential for all treatment modalities, as recurrence can occur, especially with non-surgical treatments.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "Which of the following best describes lentigo maligna?",
    options: [
      "A benign proliferation of keratinocytes",
      "A melanoma that has invaded beyond the epidermis",
      "An early form of melanoma confined to the epidermis",
      "A type of squamous cell carcinoma",
      "A reoccurring pigmented lesion with no potential for malignancy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Lentigo maligna is characterized as a melanoma in situ, which indicates it is an early form of melanoma that remains confined to the epidermis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the definitions and characteristics of the skin lesions discussed in the article. Lentigo maligna specifically refers to a type of melanoma that has not yet invaded beyond the epidermis."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the estimated lifetime risk of developing lentigo maligna melanoma from lentigo maligna?",
    options: [
      "1%",
      "5%",
      "10%",
      "15%",
      "20%"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The estimated lifetime risk of developing lentigo maligna melanoma from lentigo maligna is approximately ~5%.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the statistics provided in the article regarding the progression of lentigo maligna. It's crucial to note the specific risk percentage."
  },

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! While lentigo maligna may exhibit asymmetry, it typically does not present with consistent pain or discomfort. This feature usually suggests a different pathology.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Refer to the common signs and symptoms listed in the article. Assess the characteristics of lentigo maligna and differentiate them from other skin conditions that may cause pain."
