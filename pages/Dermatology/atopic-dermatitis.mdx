# Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema): Diagnosis and Management

Atopic dermatitis, commonly known as eczema, is the most prevalent inflammatory skin condition in the UK. It primarily manifests in early childhood with episodic itchy patches that exhibit characteristic erythema and scaling. While many children with atopic eczema experience improvement by adulthood, some may continue to have eczema or may develop it later in life. Effective management comprises general strategies such as emollient use and avoiding triggers, along with treating flare-ups using topical steroids.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis and severity classification of eczema rely on patient history and physical examination. Itchy skin is a constant symptom, while other indicative factors of eczema include:

- **Acute lesions**: Presence of erythematous, vesicular, and/or exudative skin.
- **Chronic lesions**: Signs of excoriated, lichenified skin.
- **Location**: Involvement of flexor surfaces (e.g., inside of elbows, behind knees) or extensor surfaces (e.g., cheeks in infants).
- **Past medical history**: A history of eczema or dry skin.
- **Family history**: Familial occurrence of atopy, such as asthma or allergic rhinitis.

An exhaustive skin examination is necessary, and the severity assessed according to the criteria in Table 1.

#### Table 1: Severity of Eczema

| Severity  | Itch        | Acute Lesions                                 | Chronic Lesions                            |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Clear** | -           | -                                            | -                                         |
| **Mild**  | Infrequent  | Dry, limited erythema                        | -                                         |
| **Moderate** | Frequent   | Dry, erythema                               | Excoriations, local skin thickening       |
| **Severe** | Incessant   | Extensive dry, erythema, oozing, cracking  | Excoriations, extensive thickening        |
| **Infected** | Worsening | Weeping, crusting, pustules                 | Systemically unwell                       |

## Investigations

Most patients with atopic eczema do not require further investigations. Allergy testing is warranted only if there are indications that allergens contribute to eczema flares or if eczema is refractory to optimal management strategies.

## Management (Prescribing)

Topical corticosteroids are administered in accordance with a steroid ladder to effectively control eczema flare-ups, as illustrated in Table 2.

#### Table 2: Topical Steroid Ladder

| Potency                      | Examples                                    | Use                        | Eczema Severity |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Mild                         | Hydrocortisone 0.1-2.5%                     | Delicate, thin areas of skin | Mild             |
| Moderate                     | Clobetasone (EumovateÂ®)                     |                             | Moderate         |
| Potent                       | Betamethasone (BetnovateÂ®, DiprosoneÂ®)     | Body, hands, & feet       | Severe           |
| Very Potent                  | Clobetasol propionate (DermovateÂ®)         | Specialists                |                  |

Other treatments may include:

- **Oral corticosteroids**: Short courses for severe and extensive eczema.
- **Steroid-sparing agents**: Such as topical immunomodulators like tacrolimus or pimecrolimus.
- **Antihistamines**: For severe itching or urticaria.
- **Antibiotics and antivirals**: To manage secondary infections.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Patients should receive comprehensive advice to maintain skin barrier function. This includes:

- Identifying and avoiding **exacerbating agents**.
- Regular application of **emollients**.
- Potential use of **bandaging** and **soap substitutes**.

**Note:** Consistent use of emollients can significantly improve skin hydration and barrier function.

<summary>Common Signs and Symptoms</summary>

- **Itchiness**: Constant or recurrent itching sensations.
- **Rash**: Red, dry patches in various locations, often exacerbated by scratching.
- **Skin changes**: Lichenification or areas of thickened skin due to chronic scratching.

    question: "A 5-year-old boy with a history of atopic dermatitis is brought to the clinic for a follow-up visit. His mother reports that he has been scratching his arms at night, and they appear red and inflamed. On examination, there are excoriations and lichenified plaques on his flexor surfaces. According to the severity classification table, how would you classify his eczema?",
    options: [
      "Clear",
      "Mild",
      "Moderate",
      "Severe",
      "Infected"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of excoriations and lichenification indicates that the child has moderate eczema according to the severity classification table, where frequent itching and chronic lesions are noted.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the severity classification of atopic dermatitis. Focus on the symptoms present, such as the presence of excoriations and lichenification, which can help in determining the severity."
  },
  {
    question: "A 30-year-old woman with chronic eczema presents seeking alternatives to her topical corticosteroid regimen as she is concerned about long-term use. Which of the following treatments can be considered a steroid-sparing agent?",
    options: [
      "Hydrocortisone",
      "Clobetasone",
      "Tacrolimus",
      "Betamethasone",
      "Pimecrolimus"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Tacrolimus is a topical immunomodulator that acts as a steroid-sparing agent, often used for managing eczema when corticosteroid use needs to be minimized.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the term 'steroid-sparing agent' and what it implies. Think about the class of medications indicated for atopic dermatitis that do not involve corticosteroids."

  {
    question: "A 12-year-old girl with a known history of atopic dermatitis develops weeping, crusting lesions on her forearms. She is systemically well but states that the lesions are itchy. Which type of eczema severity does her presentation most likely represent?",
    options: [
      "Clear",
      "Mild",
      "Moderate",
      "Severe",
      "Infected"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of weeping, crusting lesions suggests an infected state of eczema, as indicated in the severity classification table.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Pay attention to the key descriptors in the clinical presentation. Weeping and crusting can indicate an infection as opposed to a simple worsening of eczema."
