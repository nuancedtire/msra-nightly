# Melanocytic Naevi: An Overview

Melanocytic naevi, commonly known as **moles**, are benign neoplasms of melanocytes that contain naevus cells. They are typically small (`<1cm`), circumscribed, acquired pigmented macules, papules, or nodules found primarily in the epidermis, dermis, and occasionally, subcutaneous tissue. 

## Characteristics

- **Commonly Found On:**
  - Face
  - Trunk
  - Extremities
  - Scalp

- **Demographics:**
  - Most prevalent among individuals with light skin.
  - In darker-skinned individuals, they are more common on palms, soles, and nail beds.

**Melanocytic naevi** can appear from childhood to adulthood, with most lesions disappearing after the age of 60 due to involution and fibrosis. They are often asymptomatic, but growth may be accompanied by itching. Persistent itching or tenderness can indicate potential malignant change.

## Classification of Melanocytic Naevi

Classification is based on their evolution and histological characteristics:

| Type                          | Details                                                                                     | Location                          | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Junctional melanocytic naevi** | Arise at the dermal-epidermal junction.                                                 | Intraepidermal                    | Macules that are uniform tan, brown to black, round or oval with smooth, regular borders, and never `>1cm` in diameter.                                            |
| **Compound melanocytic naevi**   | Naevus cells invade the papillary dermis. Contains junctional and intradermal melanocytes.| Both intraepidermal and dermal    | Papules or small nodules, brown to black, dome-shaped, smooth or cobble-stone surface, soft or firm consistency, and always `<1cm` in diameter.        |
| **Dermal melanocytic naevi**     | Final stage of evolution where cells have migrated entirely into the dermis.              | Intradermal                       | Defined papule or nodule, skin-coloured to brown, often with telangiectasia, raised, dome-shaped, and diameter `<1cm`, may have hairs.                     |

### Additional Types of Acquired Melanocytic Naevus

Other types include:
- Halo naevi
- Blue naevi
- Spitz naevi

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is primarily clinical. Key symptoms and signs include:

### Symptoms
- **Asymptomatic**
- Enlargement of lesions
- Change in shape or size
- Change in pigmentation
- Itchiness, pain, or irritation
- Bleeding

### Signs
- Varied pigmentation 
- Rounded, raised, or dome-shaped lesions

### ABCDE Rule for Recognizing Malignancy

- **A**symmetry in shape
- **B**order irregularities
- **C**olor is not uniform / variegated / mottled
- **D**iameter is large
- **E**levation is present and irregular

If melanoma is suspected:

1. **Perform dermoscopy** (epiluminescence microscopy) first
2. If still indeterminate, **perform narrow margin excision biopsy**

### Differential Diagnosis

1. **Junctional melanocytic naevi**:
   - Solar lentigo
   - Flat atypical naevus
   - Lentigo maligna

2. **Compound melanocytic naevi**:
   - Seborrheic keratosis
   - Dysplastic naevi (atypical mole)
   - Small superficial spreading melanoma
   - Early nodular melanoma
   - Pigmented basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
   - Dermatofibroma

3. **Dermal melanocytic naevi**:
   - Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
   - Neurofibroma
   - Trichoepithelioma
   - Dermatofibroma
   - Sebaceous hyperplasia

## Investigations

- Typically, **no investigations** are required for common, acquired naevi that haven't changed.
- If malignant melanoma is suspected, consider:
  1. Dermoscopy
  2. Narrow margin excision biopsy if indeterminate

## Management

### Prescribing Management

- Generally, **no prescriptions** are needed.

### Non-Prescribing Management

- No treatment is required unless:
  - Cosmetic concerns arise.
  - There are suspicions of alternative diagnoses.

**Management Options:**

- **Excision biopsy:**
  - Diagnostic purpose.
  - Refer to a dermatological or plastic surgeon for cosmetic outcomes, particularly on the face.

- **Shave and cautery** (dermal electrosurgical shave excision):
  - Local anaesthetic may improve cosmetic results.

### Indications for Removal of Melanocytic Naevi

- **Site:** Scalp (atypical dermal lesions), mucous membranes, anogenital area.
- **Growth:** Rapid.
- **Colour:** Variegated.
- **Border:** Irregular.
- **Erosions:** Occurring without trauma.
- **Symptoms:** Persistent itching, pain, or bleeding.
- **Dermoscopy:** Indications of melanoma or dysplastic nevus.

If removal is indicated, an excised naevus should always be sent for histologic diagnosis and treatment.

  {
    question: "A 35-year-old man presents with a new, asymptomatic mole on his back that has developed over the past year. The mole is round, uniformly brown, and measures 0.8 cm in diameter. On examination, the borders are smooth. According to the ABCDE rule for recognizing malignancy, which of the following characteristics would most concern a clinician regarding potential malignant change?",
    options: [
      "The uniform color of the mole",
      "The size being under 1 cm",
      "The asymmetry of the mole",
      "The smooth borders of the mole",
      "The recent appearance of the mole"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! According to the ABCDE rule, asymmetry is a key feature that raises concern for malignant change in a mole. While other factors like irregular borders or variegated color are also important, it's the lack of symmetry that is emphasized in malignancy assessment. Regular and smooth borders and a diameter under 1 cm are generally not alarming.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the key factors in the ABCDE rule: Asymmetry, Border irregularities, Color uniformity, Diameter, and Elevation. Focus on the first characteristic that signals potential malignancy. Is there any abnormality in shape?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient presents with a compound melanocytic naevus on the scalp that was previously stable but has recently undergone rapid enlargement and developed irregular borders. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Observation with no intervention",
      "Shave excision for cosmetic reasons",
      "Excision biopsy for histological analysis",
      "Referral to a dermatologist without intervention",
      "Cryotherapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Rapid enlargement and irregular borders of a melanocytic naevus raise concern for malignancy. An excision biopsy is warranted to obtain a histological diagnosis and determine appropriate management.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the indications for removal of a melanocytic naevus. Why would rapid growth and irregular borders suggest a need for intervention? Consider the risks of leaving such a lesion unexamined."
  },
  {
    question: "Which feature of a melanocytic naevus is least likely to be associated with a diagnosis of melanoma?",
    options: [
      "Diameter greater than 6 mm",
      "Irregular borders",
      "Uniform pigmentation",
      "Asymmetry",
      "Elevation or change in height"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Uniform pigmentation is not typically associated with melanoma and can often indicate a benign lesion. In contrast, melanoma frequently presents with asymmetry, irregular borders, and varying pigmentation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the characteristics often linked to melanoma. Focus on how uniform pigmentation contrasts with the malignancy indicators of asymmetry and irregular borders. What does their presence signal?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 25-year-old woman has a blue naevus on her forearm that has been stable for years. Which of the following statements regarding treatment and management of blue naevi is true?",
    options: [
      "All blue naevi should be excised regardless of size or stability.",
      "Blue naevi are always malignant and require immediate intervention.",
      "Observation is sufficient for stable blue naevi unless cosmetic concerns arise.",
      "Blue naevi typically require cryotherapy as first-line treatment.",
      "Shave excision is the preferred method for all blue naevi."
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Stable blue naevi that have not changed over time generally require no treatment unless there are cosmetic concerns. Regular monitoring is key unless any other changes are noted.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the typical management strategies for stable, benign lesions. What factors determine whether a naevus requires aggressive intervention? Look at the options available for stable versus symptomatic moles."
