# Understanding Multiple Myeloma

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells in the bone marrow. Often referred to simply as myeloma, this disease frequently manifests in various locations within the body, hence the name "multiple" myeloma. If limited to one site, it's known as solitary myeloma or solitary plasmacytoma.

### Epidemiology

- **Age & Gender:** Multiple myeloma is uncommon in individuals under 40, with the average age of diagnosis being over 60. It's more prevalent in men compared to women.
- **Ethnicity:** The disease occurs more frequently in individuals of black-African descent and is less common among those of Asian heritage.

### Pathophysiology

- **Role of Plasma Cells:** As primary antibody producers, plasma cells in multiple myeloma produce excessive amounts of non-functional monoclonal antibodies, known as paraproteins or M proteins. A specific type, Bence Jones proteins, found in urine, aids diagnosis, especially when kidney dysfunction is present.
- **Spectrum of Plasma Cell Dyscrasias:** Multiple myeloma belongs to a group of plasma cell disorders that range from pre-malignant to malignant stages.

### Diagnosis

The mnemonic **CRAB** helps remember key diagnostic features:

- **C**: Hypercalcemia - Caused by increased osteoclast activity, leading to bone resorption. High calcium levels can result in lytic lesions visible in imaging.
- **R**: Renal Dysfunction - Due to high calcium levels or paraprotein deposits in kidneys, prognosis worsens.
- **A**: Anemia - Resulting from bone marrow overcrowding, presenting as normocytic, normochromic anemia, causing patient fatigue.
- **B**: Bone Pain - Increased osteoclast activity leads to resorption and pain, visible as lytic lesions on imaging.

Additional symptoms may include:

- Night sweats, weight loss, unexplained bleeding/bruising
- Recurrent infections, splenomegaly
- Paraprotein deposition signs (macroglossia, renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias)

**Risk Factors:**

- A history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
- Abnormal free light-chain ratio.

### Investigations

Suspect myeloma with the following findings together with symptoms:

- Leukopenia or anemia on full blood count (FBC)
- Rouleaux formation on blood film (RBC aggregation)
- Hypercalcemia, elevated plasma viscosity, or ESR

For patients ≥60 with suspected myeloma, perform serum protein electrophoresis and urine Bence-Jones protein testing, urgently within 48 hours.

**Diagnostic Confirmation:**

- **Imaging:** Whole-body MRI is preferred to identify lesions, with low-dose CT as an alternative.
- **Bone Marrow Examination:** Diagnosis confirmed with ≥10% monoclonal plasma cell infiltration on aspirate or biopsy.

### Management

#### Prescribing Treatments

Treatment is not always necessary for asymptomatic patients. However, in symptomatic cases:

- **Aims:** Induce remission, extend lifespan, and maintain quality of life.
- **Options:** Include chemotherapeutic and steroid medications, and agents like thalidomide.

**Complication Management:**

- **Bone Disease:** Administer bisphosphonates or denosumab.
- **Pain Management:** Follow the WHO pain ladder.
- **Renal protection:** Ensure proper hydration and educate patients on maintaining hydration during treatment.

#### Non-prescribing Interventions

Fit patients might be candidates for stem cell transplantation, using their own marrow or donor cells.

**Warning:** Continuous monitoring of vital signs during any procedure is crucial.
