# Understanding Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases have been steadily increasing around the world, with a recorded incidence rate of approximately 3:100,000 in high-income countries, rising to 78:100,000 in certain Asian and African regions. This discrepancy is largely attributed to the higher prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infections, which lead to chronic liver disease, significantly raising the risk of HCC. Additional risk factors for chronic liver disease include:

- **Intravenous drug use** (anabolic steroids)
- **Aflatoxins**
- **Excessive alcohol intake**
- **Obesity**
- **Diabetes**
- **Hypertension**

HCC is responsible for approximately 90% of primary liver cancer cases.

## Diagnosis

### Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Liver Disease:

- **Jaundice**
- **Ascites**
- **Encephalopathy**
- **Bleeding**
- **Splenomegaly**

### Additional Symptoms of Liver Tumors:

- **Fever**
- **Malaise**
- **Anorexia**
- **Weight loss**
- **Abdominal mass**

Individuals with liver cirrhosis or chronic HCV or HBV infections should undergo HCC screening via abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing every six months. The diagnosis can be confirmed through histopathological analysis or based on imaging criteria in patients with cirrhosis using CT or MRI.

### Staging of HCC (TNM Classification):

#### T – Tumor
- **TX**: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
- **T0**: No evidence of primary tumor
- **T1**: Solitary tumor `≤2 cm` with or without vascular invasion
- **T1b**: Solitary tumor `>2 cm` without vascular invasion
- **T2**: Solitary tumor `>2 cm` with vascular invasion, or multiple tumors (none `>5 cm`)
- **T3**: Multiple tumors with at least one `>5 cm`
- **T4**: Tumors involving portal or hepatic vein with direct invasion of adjacent organs (excluding the gallbladder) or perforation of visceral peritoneum

#### N – Regional Lymph Nodes
- **NX**: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
- **N0**: No regional lymph node metastasis
- **N1**: Regional lymph node metastasis

#### M – Distant Metastasis
- **M0**: No distant metastasis
- **M1**: Distant metastasis

## Investigations

- **History and Clinical Examination**: Identify risk factors and symptoms of chronic liver disease such as sudden weight loss.
- **HBsAg and Anti-HBc, Anti-HCV**: Determine etiology.
- **Laboratory Tests**: Prothrombin, albumin, bilirubin levels, and full blood count, including platelets and clotting factors, to assess liver function.
- **Serum AFP**: Tumor marker elevated in 50-80% of HCC cases; levels do not correlate with disease severity.
- **Imaging**: Multi-phase MRI or CT scans confirm diagnosis and assess disease extent.
- **Tumor Biopsy**: Confirms diagnosis, unnecessary in patients with cirrhosis and typical imaging findings.

## Management

### Prescribing

- **HBV Prevention**: As recommended by the World Health Organization, all children should receive three doses of the HBV vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months.
- **In patients with HCC tumors `<3 cm` and preserved liver function**: Radical surgical resection, thermal ablation, and/or liver transplant offer the best 5-year survival rate of 70%.
- **Advanced HCC Treatment**: First-line treatment includes transarterial chemoembolization. Other options are stereotactic body radiotherapy, brachytherapy, selective internal radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy (Sorafenib, Lenvatinib), and immunotherapy (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab).

### Non-Prescribing

- Address treatable causes of chronic liver disease with appropriate treatment.
- Advise all patients to limit or avoid alcohol consumption.
- Recommend dietary and lifestyle changes for patients with metabolic syndrome.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 55-year-old male with a history of chronic Hepatitis B infection presents with jaundice, ascites, and weight loss. Abdominal ultrasound reveals a liver mass, and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are elevated. A CT scan shows a solitary liver tumor with vascular invasion. Based on the TNM classification, what is the T stage of this tumor?",
    options: [
      "T1",
      "T1b",
      "T2",
      "T3",
      "T4"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A solitary tumor with vascular invasion corresponds to T2 stage in the TNM classification for hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the criteria for staging liver tumors. This tumor has vascular invasion, which distinguishes its classification from T1."
  },
  {
    question: "A 48-year-old woman with obesity and type 2 diabetes is undergoing regular screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to her risk factors. Which of the following is most appropriate for HCC screening in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Serum alpha-fetoprotein measurement every year",
      "Abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein measurement every six months",
      "CT scan every two years",
      "MRI scan every year",
      "Abdominal palpation and serum alpha-fetoprotein measurement every six months"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For individuals with high risk of HCC such as those with risk factors like obesity and type 2 diabetes, an abdominal ultrasound combined with serum alpha-fetoprotein measurement every six months is recommended for effective screening.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the frequency and combination of screening methods that would provide the most sensitive detection of HCC in high-risk individuals."
  },
  {
    question: "A 63-year-old patient with a known chronic Hepatitis C infection presents with malaise and abdominal mass. Imaging studies confirm the presence of multiple liver tumors, one of which is greater than 5 cm. What is the appropriate TNM classification for this presentation?",

      "T2",
      "T3",
      "N1",
      "M1",
      "T4"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Multiple tumors with at least one tumor greater than 5 cm classify as T3 in the TNM system for hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Examine the details of tumor size and number for proper staging according to the TNM classification."
  },
  {
