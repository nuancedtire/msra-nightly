# Understanding Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dementia, characterized by a decline in cognitive function and memory. It is the most prevalent cause of dementia with age being a significant risk factor.

## Overview of Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease primarily impairs cognitive abilities, which encompass several domains:

- **Memory**
- **Language**
- **Abstract Thinking**
- **Motor Skills**
- **Visuospatial Skills**
- **Executive Function**
- **Personality**
- **Social Behaviour**

Other forms of dementia, such as vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (Pick's disease), also affect these cognitive domains. Alzheimer's disease typically presents in individuals over the age of 65, with cases occurring before this age categorized as early-onset.

### Pathophysiology

The underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease involves generalized cortical atrophy, particularly affecting the temporal lobes. Two hallmark pathological features are:

- Neurofibrillary tangles
- Amyloid plaques in the cortex

These features, however, are only identifiable post-mortem.

## Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease

Diagnosis is made clinically by identifying progressive impairment in multiple cognitive domains impacting daily life. Tools such as the Abbreviated Mental Test, Mini-Mental State Examination, and others aid in assessing cognitive impairment but are not definitive for diagnosis. Diagnosis is typically made by specialist memory services and requires a collateral history, often provided by a family member.

### Clinical Presentation

Key aspects of Alzheimer's disease include:

- Short-term memory loss
- Language difficulties, particularly in word-finding
- Impaired visuospatial function
- Challenges with praxis

This condition progresses gradually over months to years.

## Investigations

While diagnosis is clinical, the following investigations are essential to exclude other causes and confirm Alzheimer's disease:

- **Blood Tests**: To rule out organic causes, including:
  - Full blood count
  - U&Es, calcium profile, thyroid function tests
  - Haematinics
  - ESR

- **Imaging**: When an infection is suspected, a chest X-ray and urine analysis are minimum requirements. MRI head scans check for treatable causes like hydrocephalus, space-occupying lesions, and vascular dementia components, which can inform treatment decisions.

- **Brain Volume Assessment**: MRI scans can reveal hippocampal volume reduction, which can be used to monitor disease progression.

- **Advanced Imaging**: PET and SPECT can demonstrate perfusion and metabolic defects, but are not typically necessary for diagnosis.

## Management of Alzheimer's Disease

### Pharmacological Treatment

Approved medications that demonstrate clinical benefits include:

- **Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors**: 
  - Donepezil
  - Rivastigmine
  - Galantamine

- **NMDA Receptor Antagonist**: 
  - Memantine

These treatments can improve cognition for six months to three years. If one medication is ineffective, another may be tried. Side effects include GI upset, with rivastigmine also causing a rash when used as a patch, which is beneficial for patients with compliance issues. Memantine may cause drowsiness and dizziness, necessitating caution in those at risk of falls.

### Non-Pharmacological Management

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
**Tip:** A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for managing Alzheimer's disease, which includes support from neurologists, geriatricians, nurses, psychiatrists, social workers, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists.

Key aspects of non-prescribing management include:

- Support with daily living activities
- Occupational therapy to ensure home safety
- Art and music therapy
- Early advance care planning and legal provisions such as Lasting Power of Attorney

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old woman presents with a 2-year history of progressive memory loss. Her family reports she has difficulty recalling recent events, frequently misplaces things, and struggles with finding words during conversations. She has no significant past medical history. On examination, she is oriented to person but not to time or place. Her Mini-Mental State Examination score is 20/30. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Vascular dementia",
      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus",
      "Alzheimer's disease",
      "Frontotemporal dementia",
      "Chronic subdural hematoma"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's age, progressive memory loss, word-finding difficulty, and orientation impairment suggest Alzheimer's disease, which is consistent with her symptoms and MMSE score.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's clinical presentation and the typical age of onset and progression of different dementia types to narrow down the diagnosis."
  },
  {
    question: "A 78-year-old man with diagnosed Alzheimer's disease is experiencing nausea and vomiting after starting a new medication. He was previously stable on donepezil, but his condition has worsened. Which medication could be the cause of his new gastrointestinal symptoms?",
    options: [
      "Memantine",
      "Rivastigmine",
      "Galantamine",
      "Donepezil",
      "Lorazepam"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in Alzheimer's disease that can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and vomiting.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the side effect profiles of medications used in the management of Alzheimer's disease and those known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms."
  },
  {
