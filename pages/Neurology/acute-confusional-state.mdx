# Understanding Delirium: A Comprehensive Guide

Delirium, also known as an acute confusional state, is a medical condition characterized by a rapid onset of cognitive impairment, perception disturbances, and altered consciousness levels. It frequently affects hospitalized patients, especially the elderly, those with existing cognitive impairments, sensory issues, or a history of alcohol dependence.

The root causes of delirium are often varied, with the most common triggers being infections, metabolic and endocrine disturbances, brain injuries, and effects of substance use or withdrawal. Management of delirium requires prompt identification and treatment of its causes, environmental optimization, and supportive care, while avoiding sedation unless critically necessary.

Delirium presents suddenly, typically over hours to days, and its symptoms vary, sometimes improving before worsening again. Full recovery may take longer for older adults. Additionally, delirium can increase the risk of long-term cognitive decline in the elderly. With a high mortality rate of up to 20%, early detection and intervention are crucial.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of delirium is primarily clinical, supported by tests that help identify the root cause. Delirium manifests in three primary forms:

- **Hyperactive Delirium**: Agitation, heightened arousal, inappropriate behavior, delusions, and hallucinations.
- **Hypoactive Delirium**: Slowed psychomotor activity, lethargy, fatigue, and social withdrawal.
- **Mixed Delirium**: Symptoms of both hyperactive and hypoactive delirium.

Patients with delirium may experience disorientation, memory loss, sleep disturbances, mood fluctuations, and incoherent speech. These symptoms typically fluctuate throughout the day and often worsen in the evening, a phenomenon known as "sun-downing."

A full medical history, particularly from collateral sources, and a thorough examination are essential. This includes reviewing the patient's medication history for any drugs that may precipitate or contribute to delirium.

Cognitive assessment tools like the AMT are less useful during delirium's acute phase, but tools such as the MMSE can help monitor recovery post-acute phase.

## Investigations

Hospital guidelines for investigating delirium aim to uncover causative factors. The mnemonic "PINCH ME" summarizes the most common causes of delirium:

- Pain
- Infection
- Nutrition
- Constipation
- Hydration
- Medication
- Electrolyte disturbances
- Environment

A standard "confusion screen" typically consists of:

- Routine blood tests: Full Blood Count (FBC), Urea & Electrolytes (U&Es)
- Additional blood tests: Haematinics, Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs), Liver Function Tests (LFTs), CRP/ESR, Calcium profile
- Blood cultures for suspected infections
- Urinalysis and Midstream Specimen of Urine (MSU) for urinary tract infections (UTIs)
- Chest X-ray (CXR) as part of an infective screen

Cranial imaging may be necessary if a neurological cause is suspected or if delirium persists beyond expected durations or no other cause is identified.

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

Delirium can cause patients to become extremely agitated or aggressive. Sedation is generally avoided due to potential side effects and ethical considerations. However, when a patient's behavior becomes a safety concern, pharmacological intervention may be required.

The first approach is always de-escalation. If unsuccessful, medications like haloperidol, benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam), and atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine) may be used cautiously. Respiratory depression is a risk with benzodiazepines, especially in the elderly. Haloperidol is contraindicated in Parkinson's disease patients.

Pharmacological sedation should be minimized, monitored closely, and discontinued as soon as possible.

## Management (Prescribing)

Pharmacological management of delirium-related agitation is a last resort. Treatment is usually symptom-oriented—antibiotics for infections, laxatives for constipation, analgesics for pain, etc. Medication review is vital as certain drugs can trigger delirium, and polypharmacy is a known risk factor.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Non-pharmacological interventions are central to managing delirium. This involves:

- Ensuring patient safety
- Providing adequate lighting
- Minimizing noise
- Encouraging mobility
- Addressing sensory deficits (e.g., using hearing aids or glasses)
- Employing regular orientation techniques

Effective communication with patients and caregivers is key for orientation. Visual aids like clocks and calendars also support reorientation to time.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 78-year-old male with a history of dementia is brought to the emergency department by his family for increased confusion and agitation over the past day. His temperature is 38.2°C, blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg, and heart rate is 102 bpm. Physical examination reveals no focal neurological deficits, but the patient is disoriented to time and place. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Initiate haloperidol for agitation control",
      "Perform a thorough investigation to identify potential causes of delirium",
      "Prescribe benzodiazepines for sedation",
      "Commence antibiotic therapy empirically",
      "Discharge with instructions for outpatient follow-up"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's acute onset of confusion and agitation, fever, and altered vitals suggest delirium possibly due to an infection. A thorough investigation to determine the underlying cause, which may include infections, is crucial before initiating specific treatments.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While managing agitation is important, the priority should be to identify potential underlying causes. What tests or assessments would be most informative in this case?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a common cause of hypoactive delirium in hospitalized patients?",
    options: [
      "Excessive stimulation from the hospital environment",
      "Severe pain or discomfort",
      "Intracranial hemorrhage",
      "Withdrawal from alcohol",
      "Overdose of stimulant medications"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Hypoactive delirium is characterized by slowed psychomotor activity and lethargy, which can be caused by severe pain or discomfort among other factors. Identification and management of the underlying cause are essential.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the clinical features of hypoactive delirium and the factors that could contribute to decreased psychomotor activity and alertness in hospitalized patients."

    question: "A 65-year-old woman with a history of Parkinson’s disease is admitted with acute delirium. The medical team is considering pharmacological intervention due to her agitation and potential risk to herself and the staff. Which of the following medications is contraindicated in this patient?",
    options: [

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Haloperidol is contraindicated in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of exacerbating motor symptoms. An alternative antipsychotic with fewer extrapyramidal side effects should be considered.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient’s underlying condition and the potential adverse effects of antipsychotic medications, particularly on motor function."
