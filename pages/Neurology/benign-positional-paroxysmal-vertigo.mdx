# Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)

Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a common vestibular disorder that induces brief but intense episodes of vertigo with specific head movements. This condition is often characterized by a sensation of spinning, commonly known as dizziness.

The mechanism behind BPPV involves dislodged otolithsâ€”calcified particlesâ€”within the semicircular canals of the inner ear. These otoliths disrupt the normal fluid movement that senses head position, leading to episodes of vertigo. While the root cause of otolith displacement is often not determined, BPPV can be triggered by factors such as head injuries, viral infections, or other inner ear disorders like Meniereâ€™s disease. Although BPPV is non-life-threatening, it can significantly impact quality of life, especially with recurrent episodes.

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Presentation
- Vertigo triggered by movements such as:
  - Turning in bed
  - Lying down
  - Sitting up
  - Looking upwards
  - Bending forward
- Accompanying nausea
- Episode duration from seconds to minutes
- Absence of neurological deficits
- Possible presence of nystagmus upon examination

### Diagnostic Maneuvers
- **Dix-Hallpike Maneuver**
  - Procedure:
    1. The patient lies back quickly with the examiner tilting the head 30 degrees below the horizontal plane.
    2. The maneuver is conducted with the right ear facing down, followed by the left.
  - A positive result is indicated by vertigo and nystagmus, confirming BPPV.

## Investigations

BPPV is primarily diagnosed based on clinical findings. However, when the diagnosis is uncertain, symptoms persist, or neurological signs are present, further evaluation is warranted.

- **MRI of the Head**: Preferred imaging technique when other conditions are considered.
- Additional tests for potential causes, such as infection or head injury, should be conducted as needed.

## Management

### Prescribing Interventions
BPPV often resolves on its own, but when necessary, certain maneuvers have shown a high rate of effectiveness (80-90%). If BPPV persists, medications can provide symptomatic relief.

- **Medications**:
  - Antihistamines: Cyclizine
  - Histamine analogues: Betahistine
  - Anticholinergics: Hyoscine butylbromide
- Note: Medications are typically used for acute episodes, and there is limited evidence for long-term pharmacological management.

### Non-Prescribing Interventions
Corrective maneuvers are the primary intervention for BPPV, with a high success rate in resolving episodes. These maneuvers can be taught to patients for self-management.

- **Corrective Maneuvers**:
  - Epley Maneuver: An extension of the Dix-Hallpike test with additional head rotations.
  - Semontâ€™s Maneuver: A simpler technique that involves lying to one side until vertigo ceases, then quickly moving to the opposite side.
  - Brandt-Daroff Exercises: Positional exercises that can be practiced at home.

**Note:** In persistent and severe cases unresponsive to other treatments, a surgical option, semicircular canal occlusion, may be considered.

<summary>Learn More About BPPV Pathophysiology</summary>

BPPV occurs when otoliths in the inner ear's semicircular canals shift, leading to abnormal stimulation of the vestibular system. This can result in the brain receiving incorrect information about the body's position in space, causing the sensation of spinning or vertigo.
