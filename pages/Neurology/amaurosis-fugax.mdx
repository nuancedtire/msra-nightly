# Amaurosis Fugax: Understanding and Managing Transient Vision Loss

Amaurosis fugax is a temporary and typically painless vision loss that can affect one or both eyes. This phenomenon can signal various neurological and ophthalmological conditions, including embolisms, vasculitides, inflammatory eye diseases, optic neuritis, and space-occupying lesions. A common cause is emboli from carotid or coronary vessels, which can indicate a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Recognition of amaurosis fugax is critical, as it may precede a complete ischemic stroke and permanent vision loss. Described as a "curtain descending over the eye," episodes usually last between 5 to 15 minutes. When caused by embolism, the extent of visual field loss can vary, from quadrantanopia to complete anopia, depending on the ophthalmic artery branch occlusion.

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Evaluation

The diagnosis of amaurosis fugax is primarily based on the patient's account of the event. However, to pinpoint the specific cause, a thorough clinical examination is necessary.

- **Neurological Examination:**
  - Assess visual fields to determine the nature and extent of vision loss.
  - Look for additional neurological symptoms, such as contralateral limb weakness.

- **Ophthalmological Examination:**
  - Performed by specialists to provide a detailed eye assessment and may include advanced imaging.

A complete medical history and general examination are essential to identify the root cause of the event.

## Investigations

Although amaurosis fugax is a diagnosis made from the patient's description, further investigations are imperative for identifying the underlying cause and determining the appropriate management strategy.

### Imaging

- **CT Scan of the Head:**
  - An urgent investigation to rule out ischemic or hemorrhagic events, as well as space-occupying lesions.

- **MRI Scan:**
  - Follow-up imaging to detect subtler infarcts not visible on the CT.

- **Carotid Doppler Scans:**
  - Evaluate carotid arteries for emboli or atherosclerosis, which might necessitate a carotid endarterectomy.

### Laboratory Tests

- Basic blood tests (FBC, U&Es;) to check for infections, electrolyte imbalances, and establish treatment baselines.
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to detect inflammation, as in giant cell arteritis.
- Lipid panel and blood glucose levels to assess for atherosclerotic disease risk factors like TIA and stroke.

## Management

### Prescribing Interventions

The approach to managing amaurosis fugax depends on the identified cause.

- **Embolic Causes (TIA or Stroke):**
  - Initial treatment with high-dose aspirin for two weeks, followed by long-term antiplatelet therapy.
  - Secondary prevention with statins and antihypertensives.
  - Management of concurrent conditions such as diabetes.
  - Evaluate thrombosis risk and consider long-term anticoagulation.

- **Inflammatory Conditions:**
  - Steroids are the primary treatment for conditions like giant cell arteritis and optic neuritis.
  - Long-term high-dose steroids for giant cell arteritis, typically for 12-18 months, with a gradual weaning process.
  - Proton pump inhibitors and bisphosphonates to protect the gastrointestinal tract and bones from steroid side effects.

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

- **Carotid Endarterectomy:**
  - Potentially indicated for carotid artery emboli, except in cases of severe or complete stenosis.
  - Intervention considerations include moderate stenosis (50-70%) and evaluating the contralateral artery.

- **Lifestyle Modifications:**
  - Advise on a healthy diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking, and reducing alcohol intake.
  - Address concurrent medical risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
  - Post-TIA driving advice: abstain from driving for one month and only resume if visual symptoms have fully resolved. Notify DVLA if impairment persists.

- **Support for Permanent Visual Deficits:**
  - Implement occupational therapy and consider registering affected individuals as visually-impaired for appropriate support.

**Warning:** Amaurosis fugax can be an early warning sign of a stroke. Immediate medical attention is crucial.

  {
    question: "A 58-year-old man presents with a 10-minute episode of vision loss in his left eye described as a 'curtain coming down,' which resolved spontaneously. He has a history of hypertension and smoking. Physical examination is unremarkable, but a carotid Doppler scan reveals 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Immediate carotid endarterectomy",
      "Start high-dose aspirin and schedule a follow-up in 6 months",
      "Begin long-term anticoagulation with warfarin",
      "Prescribe a proton pump inhibitor and advise lifestyle modifications",
      "Start high-dose aspirin followed by long-term antiplatelet therapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's symptoms are indicative of amaurosis fugax, likely due to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) from carotid artery stenosis. High-dose aspirin is initiated immediately, followed by long-term antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention. Carotid endarterectomy may be considered depending on the degree of stenosis and patient-specific factors.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember, the patient's presentation suggests a TIA, which requires immediate treatment to reduce the risk of stroke. What is the standard of care for secondary prevention in TIA patients?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old woman with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica reports sudden vision loss in her right eye that lasted for approximately 15 minutes. She also complains of jaw claudication and a new headache. Her ESR is elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis, and what is the first-line treatment?",
    options: [
      "Optic neuritis; intravenous methylprednisolone",
      "Central retinal artery occlusion; ocular massage and high-flow oxygen",
      "Embolic TIA; high-dose aspirin and long-term antiplatelet therapy",
      "Giant cell arteritis; high-dose oral steroids",
      "Space-occupying lesion; urgent neurosurgical referral"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's symptoms, along with jaw claudication, new headache, and elevated ESR, are highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis. The first-line treatment is high-dose oral steroids to prevent further vision loss and other complications.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's age, systemic symptoms, and elevated inflammatory markers. Which condition can cause transient vision loss and has a risk of permanent blindness without prompt treatment?"
  },

      "Increase calcium intake",
      "Start a ketogenic diet",
      "Engage in regular aerobic exercise",
      "Take herbal supplements known to improve vision",
      "Increase protein intake to prevent muscle wasting"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Engaging in regular aerobic exercise is an important lifestyle modification for this patient to help manage diabetes and reduce the risk of atherosclerotic disease, which can lead to TIAs and stroke.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the modifiable risk factors for atherosclerosis and stroke prevention. Which lifestyle change has a direct impact on these risk factors?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 50-year-old woman with a history of amaurosis fugax is evaluated for carotid artery disease. An ultrasound reveals 70% stenosis of her right internal carotid artery. She has no other neurological deficits. What is the most appropriate intervention?",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Carotid endarterectomy is potentially indicated for this patient, who has significant carotid artery stenosis and a history of amaurosis fugax, which can be a manifestation of TIA due to carotid artery disease.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the degree of stenosis and the patient's history of transient visual symptoms. What is the evidence-based intervention for significant carotid stenosis to prevent stroke?"
