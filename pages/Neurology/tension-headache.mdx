# Tension Headaches: Diagnosis and Management

Tension headaches are the most prevalent type of headache among patients. However, the exact mechanisms causing tension headaches are not fully understood.

## Pathophysiology

- The underlying pathophysiology of tension headaches is not well-defined.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Pathophysiology</summary>

The specific cause of tension headaches remains elusive to researchers, indicating the need for further scientific study to understand the mechanisms involved.

## Diagnosis of Tension Headaches

### Clinical Diagnosis

- Diagnosing tension headaches relies on clinical assessment.
- Additional tests are generally unnecessary unless other conditions must be ruled out.

### Patient Presentation

- Symptoms include a tight, band-like headache that is diffuse and of mild to moderate intensity.
- Duration ranges from a few hours to several days.
- Daily activities are typically unaffected.
- Most commonly occurs in adolescents and adults.

### Classification

- **Episodic Tension Headaches**: Occur `<15 days` per month.
- **Chronic Tension Headaches**: Occur `>15 days` per month.

### Common Triggers

- Stress and anxiety
- Fatigue
- Dehydration
- Skipping meals
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Poor posture

## Investigations

- Routine tests are not required for confirming tension headaches.

**Note:** Red flags in symptoms may necessitate further investigations to exclude more serious conditions.
</Callout>

### Red Flag Symptoms

- Abrupt onset
- Exceptional severity
- Accompanied by confusion, neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, nausea, or vomiting
- Preceding significant head injury
- Associated with neurological deficits such as weakness, sensory changes, or speech difficulties

## Management of Tension Headaches

### Prescribing Treatment

- Simple analgesics are typically effective.
  
<Callout emoji="💊">
**First-Line Options:** The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises using paracetamol or ibuprofen.
</Callout>

- Consider codeine for unrelieved pain by other analgesics, but be cautious of potential medication-overuse headaches.
  
<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Codeine is not generally recommended for routine use.
</Callout>

- For chronic tension headaches, low-dose amitriptyline may be used off-label as a preventative treatment.

### Non-Prescribing Treatment

- Encourage patients to maintain a headache diary tracking occurrence, frequency, severity, and triggers.

#### Lifestyle Modifications

- Engage in regular physical activity and relaxation techniques.
- Adjust diet to avoid known triggers.
- Practice good sleep hygiene.
- Focus on maintaining proper posture.
- Ensure adequate hydration.

<summary>Additional Non-Pharmacological Interventions</summary>

For persistent chronic tension headaches, NICE suggests considering up to 10 acupuncture sessions over 5-8 weeks.

    question: "A 30-year-old woman presents with a headache described as a constant, tight band around her head, lasting for hours at a time. She experiences these headaches on average 10 days per month. She denies any associated nausea, vomiting, or photophobia. No neurological deficits are noted on examination. Based on the information provided, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Episodic tension headache",
      "Chronic tension headache",
      "Migraine without aura",
      "Cluster headache",
      "Subarachnoid hemorrhage"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's symptoms are characteristic of episodic tension headaches, which occur less than 15 days per month and lack the associated features of migraine or cluster headaches.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the frequency and the clinical features of the headaches. The absence of nausea, vomiting, or photophobia and the description of the headache are clues to the correct diagnosis."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with chronic tension headaches has been using over-the-counter analgesics almost daily for several months. Despite this, their headache frequency and intensity have not improved. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Increase the dose of current analgesics",
      "Initiate prophylactic treatment with low-dose amitriptyline",
      "Prescribe a course of oral corticosteroids",
      "Refer for immediate neurosurgical evaluation",
      "Schedule an MRI of the brain"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For chronic tension headaches unresponsive to simple analgesics, initiating a prophylactic treatment such as low-dose amitriptyline is appropriate.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the potential for medication-overuse headaches and the need for preventive treatments in patients with frequent tension headaches."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following lifestyle modifications is NOT typically recommended for patients with tension headaches?",
    options: [
      "Practicing relaxation techniques",
      "Maintaining regular physical activity",
      "Ensuring adequate hydration",
      "Skipping meals to avoid food triggers",
      "Focusing on maintaining proper posture"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Skipping meals is not recommended as it can be a trigger for tension headaches. Instead, patients should adjust their diet to avoid known triggers but maintain regular meal patterns.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the lifestyle modifications that are beneficial for tension headache management and consider which option might actually exacerbate headaches."
  },
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old male with a past medical history of tension headaches now presents with a new severe headache of abrupt onset, confusion, and photophobia. He describes the headache as 'the worst headache of his life.' What is the most appropriate initial action?",
    options: [
      "Prescribe a higher dose of ibuprofen",
      "Schedule an outpatient MRI of the brain",
      "Admit for inpatient observation and headache management",
      "Perform a lumbar puncture",
      "Arrange for immediate neuroimaging"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's presentation includes red flag symptoms such as abrupt onset, exceptional severity, and associated confusion and photophobia, which may indicate a subarachnoid hemorrhage or another serious condition, necessitating immediate neuroimaging.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reconsider the urgency and potential seriousness of the patient's symptoms. Which option would be the most appropriate and immediate action given the red flag symptoms?"
