# Subarachnoid Hematomas: Understanding and Managing Intracranial Bleeds

Subarachnoid hematomas (SAH) are a form of intracranial hemorrhage characterized by bleeding into the subarachnoid space, which lies between the arachnoid and pia mater membranes surrounding the brain. Unlike intracerebral hemorrhages where bleeding occurs directly within the brain tissues, SAH is external to the pia mater. These hemorrhages can occur spontaneously, often due to ruptured aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations, or as a result of trauma. In the UK, SAH has an incidence of about 1 in 10,000 annually and can be life-threatening.

## Diagnosis of SAH

### Symptoms and Signs

- **Thunderclap Headache:**
  - Sudden and severe, described as the worst headache experienced.
  - Often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and visual disturbances.
  - Can be triggered by physical exertion or sexual activity.

- **Neurological and Systemic Manifestations:**
  - Decreased Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score.
  - Meningism signs (neck stiffness, photophobia, and headache).
  - Fever and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as hypotension and bradycardia.
  - Severe cases may lead to seizures, coma, or sudden death.

- **Demographic Risk Factors:**
  - Higher risk in women compared to men.
  - Incidence rises with age, though many patients are under 50 years old.

### Red Flag Features and Urgent Investigation

- Urgent evaluation is necessary for headaches with red flag features indicative of SAH.
- Initial diagnosis is commonly made with a CT scan, which may reveal subarachnoid bleeding.
- A lumbar puncture is warranted if a CT scan is inconclusive, as imaging sensitivity decreases over time.

**Warning:** A headache with red flag features requires immediate medical attention and investigation to rule out SAH.

## Investigative Procedures

### Primary Investigations

- **CT Head:**
  - High sensitivity within the first 24 hours (95%).
  - Sensitivity declines to 74% by day 3 and to 50% by day 7.

- **Lumbar Puncture (LP):**
  - Necessary when CT is negative.
  - Diagnostic indicators include the presence of blood in the CSF and xanthochromia, a yellow discoloration of CSF due to bilirubin formation.

### Additional Tests

- Routine blood tests (Full Blood Count (FBC), Urea & Electrolytes (U&Es)) to exclude other medical causes of headaches.
- Coagulation screen and blood typing in preparation for potential surgical intervention.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect ST elevation and monitor for arrhythmias associated with SAH.

## Emergency Management of SAH

In major SAH events, patients may present with life-threatening symptoms:

- Decreased GCS, seizures, coma, and signs of increased intracranial pressure.
- The ABCDE approach is vital alongside resuscitative efforts.
- Consultation with neurosurgery is imperative.

### Maintaining Cerebral Perfusion

- Keep Intracranial Pressure (ICP) below 25 mmHg.
- Aim for a systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg to prevent increased ICP.
- Use of mannitol and inotropes might be necessary.

### Monitoring for Complications

- Continuous observation for seizures, infections, hydrocephalus, re-bleeding, and elevated ICP.
- Manage Cushing’s reflex, characterized by hypertension, bradycardia, and reduced respiratory rate, by lowering ICP.

## Pharmacological Management

### Prescribing Considerations

- Provide strong analgesics, possibly opioids, for severe headache management.
- Administer antiemetics as needed.
- Nimodipine is critical for reducing the risk of vasospasm and subsequent cerebral ischemia.

<summary>Prescribing Nimodipine</summary>

Nimodipine should be titrated against systolic blood pressure, maintaining it above 100 mmHg. Recommended duration is three weeks post-presentation.

- Ensure hydration with normal saline.

## Non-Pharmacological Management

### Acute Care and Specialist Consultation

- Enforce bed rest in the immediate phase.
- Engage in resuscitation and acute head injury management when necessary.
- Consultation with neurosurgery for definitive treatment plans.

### Surgical and Supportive Treatments

- Perform angiography to identify causative aneurysms, with endovascular coiling as the first-line treatment.
- Surgical removal for arteriovenous malformations.
- Traumatic SAH typically managed conservatively without surgical intervention.

### Rehabilitation

- Extensive neuro-rehabilitation may be required, involving multidisciplinary teams including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and neurologists.

    question: "A 55-year-old woman presents with a sudden onset of 'the worst headache of her life' following sexual activity. She also reports nausea and photophobia. Her blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, and she has a GCS score of 14. A non-contrast CT head is performed within 2 hours of symptom onset. If the CT scan is negative for subarachnoid hemorrhage, what is the next best step in management?",
    options: [
      "Repeat the CT head in 24 hours",
      "Immediate cerebral angiography",
      "Perform a lumbar puncture to test for xanthochromia",
      "Initiate treatment with mannitol for suspected increased ICP",
      "Prescribe nimodipine and monitor blood pressure"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! If the initial CT scan is negative but clinical suspicion for subarachnoid hemorrhage is high, a lumbar puncture to look for xanthochromia is indicated. This can confirm the diagnosis when CT sensitivity is reduced.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While the initial CT scan is highly sensitive, it is not infallible. What would be the most appropriate investigation to confirm a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage when the CT scan is negative but clinical suspicion remains high?"
