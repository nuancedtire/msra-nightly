# Extradural Hematoma: Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

Extradural hematoma, often associated with head trauma, is a medical condition that results in a collection of blood between the dura mater and the skull. The temporoparietal region is the most common site of injury, typically involving a rupture in the middle meningeal artery, although veins or dural sinuses can also be affected. Rarely, it can arise from arteriovenous malformations. Outcomes can vary from full recovery to severe complications such as infection, cognitive issues, epilepsy, hemiparesis, or brainstem injury.

## Clinical Presentation

### Signs and Symptoms

Patients with extradural hematoma may experience:

- A lucid interval post-injury, lasting hours to days
- Initial confusion or fatigue at the time of trauma
- Progressing symptoms like severe headaches, confusion, and vomiting
- Neurological deficits including hemiparesis, seizures, and coma if untreated
- **Neurological Signs:**
  - Brisk reflexes and a positive Babinski's sign
  - A fixed, dilated pupil on the affected side
- **Complications:**
  - Brainstem herniation through the foramen magnum
  - Subsequent coning and potential brainstem death

**Warning:** Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure due to the risk of coning.

## Diagnostic Approach

### Assessment and Imaging

- Perform an A-E assessment on patients with head injuries and altered consciousness.
- **Airway Management:**
  - Ensure airway security; provide support as needed.
- **Imaging:**
  - Urgently conduct a non-contrast CT scan of the head.
  - Identify the "lemon-shaped" extradural hematoma, which differs from the "banana-shaped" subdural hematoma.
  - Use angiography to investigate potential arteriovenous malformations without a trauma history.
  - A skull X-ray can indicate fractures but is less sensitive than CT.

## Emergency Diagnosis and Management

Upon diagnosis of extradural hematoma:

- Refer the patient for urgent neurosurgical intervention
- **Prognostic Indicators:**
  - A good prognosis is linked to swift surgical intervention.
  - A lower GCS at presentation, fixed and dilated pupils, or decerebrate posturing suggest a poorer prognosis.

## Treatment Strategies

### Medical Management (Prescribing)

- **Intracranial Pressure Control:**
  - Administer mannitol and barbiturates to reduce intracranial pressure.
- **Infection Prevention:**
  - Provide prophylactic antibiotics for open skull fractures to prevent meningitis.
- **Seizure Management:**
  - Use anticonvulsants to prevent seizures related to increased intracranial pressure.

### Surgical Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Initial Steps:**
  - Follow an A-E approach for trauma patients.
  - Implement C-spine immobilization, provide oxygen, and perform intubation and ventilation if indicated.
- **Neurosurgical Objectives:**
  - Decompress the skull, evacuate the clot, and halt further bleeding.
  - Procedures may include drilling a burr hole or performing a craniectomy to access and repair bleeding vessels.

## Conclusion

Extradural hematoma is a critical condition requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention to prevent severe outcomes. Through proper management and treatment, patients can have a favorable prognosis, but awareness of potential complications is essential for clinicians.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after falling from a ladder. He initially lost consciousness but was lucid upon arrival. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is 14. He is now complaining of a severe headache and has started vomiting. His right pupil is dilated and non-reactive to light. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    options: [
      "Immediate lumbar puncture to assess for subarachnoid hemorrhage",
      "Administer mannitol and prepare for urgent neurosurgical consultation",
      "Perform a skull X-ray to assess for fractures",
      "Schedule a non-urgent MRI of the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury",
      "Wait and observe the patient as the symptoms may resolve spontaneously"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's symptoms suggest an extradural hematoma, particularly the dilated pupil on the affected side which indicates increased intracranial pressure. Urgent neurosurgical consultation is required, and mannitol can be administered to reduce intracranial pressure while awaiting surgery.",
    incorrectFeedback: "A dilated pupil, severe headache, and vomiting following head trauma are critical signs that should prompt immediate action. Which diagnostic procedure is contraindicated due to increased intracranial pressure, and what management would be urgent to address a potential extradural hematoma?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which imaging finding is most characteristic of an extradural hematoma?",
    options: [
      "A crescent-shaped hyperdensity crossing suture lines",
      "A 'lemon-shaped' hyperdensity adjacent to the skull",
      "A diffuse swelling of the brain parenchyma",
      "Multiple petechial hemorrhages throughout the brain",
      "A 'banana-shaped' hyperdensity beneath the dura mater"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! On a non-contrast CT scan, an extradural hematoma typically appears as a 'lemon-shaped' hyperdensity adjacent to the skull, which is in contrast to the 'banana-shaped' hyperdensity of a subdural hematoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Recall the differences in appearance between extradural hematomas and other types of intracranial hemorrhages on CT scans. Which description best matches the characteristic appearance of an extradural hematoma?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 30-year-old woman is involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffers a head injury. She's alert and oriented with a GCS score of 15. However, she has a small amount of clear fluid leaking from her nose. A non-contrast CT scan of her head reveals a 'lemon-shaped' hyperdensity near the temporoparietal region. Which of the following complications should be urgently addressed to prevent a potential life-threatening scenario?",
    options: [
      "Acute respiratory distress syndrome",
      "Brainstem herniation and subsequent coning",
      "Anterior spinal artery syndrome",
      "Tension pneumothorax",
      "Cardiac tamponade"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An extradural hematoma can lead to increased intracranial pressure and potentially cause brainstem herniation, which is a life-threatening condition. Immediate neurosurgical intervention is required to prevent coning.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the complications associated with an extradural hematoma and increased intracranial pressure. Which of these complications is directly life-threatening and necessitates immediate action?"

    question: "A 45-year-old construction worker presents with a history of head trauma. He experiences a brief loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval. His examination is notable for brisk reflexes and a positive Babinski's sign on the left side. What does this clinical finding indicate?",
    options: [
      "Normal physiological response in an adult",
      "Probable lesion in the peripheral nervous system",
      "Likely upper motor neuron lesion affecting the right hemisphere",
      "Indication of a lower motor neuron lesion on the left side",
      "Evidence of a transient ischemic attack (TIA)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of brisk reflexes and a positive Babinski's sign, which is an extension of the great toe with fanning of the other toes upon stimulation of the plantar surface of the foot, is indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. Given the history of trauma and lateralizing signs, this suggests a lesion in the contralateral (right) hemisphere.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Recall the significance of brisk reflexes and a positive Babinski's sign in an adult patient. What do these signs typically indicate in the context of a recent head injury?"
