# Basal Skull Fractures: Overview and Management

Basal skull fractures are injuries to the skull base, comprising parts of the ethmoid, sphenoid, occipital, frontal, and temporal bones. These fractures typically result from traumatic head injuries due to direct impact, with common causes including road traffic accidents, sports injuries, and assaults. Younger individuals are more frequently affected due to their higher involvement in high-risk activities.

Although many basal skull fractures heal with minimal complications, they can be associated with serious issues like intracranial injury and other complications, potentially leading to significant morbidity and mortality. It is crucial to evaluate for signs of intracranial hemorrhage or concurrent facial fractures in suspected cases. Serious complications to watch for include CSF leaks, meningitis, and cranial nerve palsies.

## Diagnosis

A clinical suspicion of basal skull fracture should be based on the injury's mechanism and presenting signs and symptoms. Confirmation is usually achieved through CT scans, which are the preferred imaging modality.

### Clinical Presentation

Symptoms vary depending on the affected skull base area and potential complications, but general signs of head injury are common:

- Headache
- Reduced consciousness
- Nausea

Damage to cranial nerves like the oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, facial, and vestibulocochlear nerves can lead to ophthalmoplegia, facial droop, and hearing loss, respectively.

#### Key Clinical Signs

Certain signs are strongly indicative of basal skull fractures:

- **"Raccoon eyes"** - bilateral periorbital bruising
- **Battle's sign** - bruising over the mastoid process
- **Otorrhagia** - ear bleeding
- **CSF otorrhea** - CSF leakage from the ear
- **CSF rhinorrhea** - CSF leakage from the nose

The latter two signs are particularly indicative of CSF leaks.

## Investigations

CT imaging is the investigative tool of choice for detecting basal skull fractures. In contrast, plain x-rays and MRI scans have limited diagnostic value here. Beta-transferrin testing should be conducted on any nasal or ear discharge when a CSF leak is suspected, as this protein is exclusively found in CSF.

## Management

### Prescribing

Basal skull fractures generally heal without specific medical treatments. Still, symptomatic support with analgesics and antiemetics may be necessary. Monitoring patients on anticoagulants for neurological decline is essential due to the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, and withholding the anticoagulant might be required.

**Note:** Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent meningitis post-fracture are not supported by current evidence, despite previous routine use.

### Non-Prescribing

Fracture management is typically conservative, though neurosurgical interventions can be necessary for displaced fractures, intracranial hemorrhage, significant cranial nerve damage, and persistent CSF leaks. Surgical options may include decompression and repair of CSF leaks. Importantly, nasogastric tubes are contraindicated, with orogastric tubes preferred for feeding when necessary.

A comprehensive trauma assessment focusing on airway, breathing, circulation, and C-spine stabilization is paramount for initial management, in line with protocols for traumatic head injuries.
