# Subdural Hematomas: Diagnosis and Management

Subdural hematomas (SDH) are defined as bleeding into the subdural space, which is the area between the dura mater and arachnoid mater of the brain. Typically resulting from head injuries, SDHs are known for causing tears in the bridging veins and arteries within the subdural space. Acute SDHs are particularly severe, carrying the highest mortality rate among all traumatic brain injuries.

## Overview of SDH

SDH can be categorized into acute or chronic types, each presenting with distinct symptoms:

### Acute SDH

- Loss of consciousness or reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) following head trauma.
- May accompany symptoms like headache, seizures, vomiting, or acute neurological deficits.
- Symptoms develop more slowly than those associated with extradural or subarachnoid hematomas due to bleeding from veins rather than higher-pressure arteries.

### Chronic SDH

- Typically presents 4-8 weeks post head injury.
- Gradual onset of headaches, cognitive decline, impaired consciousness, and neurological deficits.
- Common in older adults, often as a late consequence of minor or moderate head trauma.
- A critical differential diagnosis for elderly patients with headaches and progressive neurological decline.
- A thorough history of falls is essential in such cases.

### Risk Factors

- Increased risk with cerebral atrophy, making SDH more prevalent in the elderly, individuals with dementia, and alcoholics.
- SDHs are also a component of the 'shaken baby syndrome' triad, which includes retinal hemorrhages and encephalopathy.

## Diagnostic Approach

### Imaging

- **CT Scan:** The primary diagnostic tool, revealing a high-density crescent-shaped bleed in acute SDH.
- **MRI Scan:** Can provide additional details if the diagnosis is uncertain, especially for subacute or chronic SDHs with less apparent bleeds on CT.

### Additional Investigations

- Routine blood tests to exclude other medical causes.
- Coagulation profile to identify any bleeding disorders.
- Group and save/crossmatch in preparation for potential neurosurgery.

**Warning:** Both anemia and coagulopathy can exacerbate acute hemorrhages.

## Emergency Diagnosis and Management

SDHs typically constitute a medical emergency:

- Apply the ABCDE approach and carry out necessary resuscitation for serious head injuries.
- Prioritize urgent investigations and consult neurosurgery promptly.
- Intensive care unit (ICU) management for severe acute bleeds, including ventilation, continuous vital signs monitoring, and intracranial pressure monitoring.

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Considerations

- Provide supportive care with adequate analgesia and anti-emetics.
- For potential surgical candidates, enforce fasting and maintain hydration with intravenous fluids.
- In chronic SDH, administer 2mg of dexamethasone thrice daily and proton pump inhibitor cover to reduce cerebral edema.

### Surgical Intervention

- Acute SDH: Consider immediate trauma craniotomy to evacuate the hematoma and achieve hemostasis.
- Chronic SDH: Evaluate for surgical eligibility, especially in elderly patients. Options include burr-hole drainage or subdural drains.
- Non-surgical treatment may be considered for certain patients.

### Post-Operative Care

- Patients may require extensive neuro-rehabilitation involving physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and neurology specialists after the acute management phase.

Post-operative care for SDH patients may involve a multidisciplinary team to address the various aspects of recovery and improve overall functionality.

  {
    question: "A 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension and alcohol abuse presents with a 3-week history of progressive headache and confusion. He has no recent history of head trauma. A non-contrast CT scan of the head reveals a crescent-shaped, hypodense collection over the left cerebral hemisphere. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Acute subdural hematoma",
      "Chronic subdural hematoma",
      "Extradural hematoma",
      "Subarachnoid hemorrhage",
      "Cerebral atrophy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The gradual onset of symptoms and hypodense crescent-shaped collection on CT in an elderly patient with risk factors like hypertension and alcohol abuse are suggestive of a chronic subdural hematoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's age, risk factors, and the chronicity of symptoms along with the CT findings to arrive at the most likely diagnosis."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with an acute subdural hematoma is being prepared for a trauma craniotomy. Which of the following steps should be taken before surgery?",
    options: [
      "Administration of mannitol to reduce intracranial pressure",
      "Ensuring the patient has a full stomach to prevent hypoglycemia",
      "Immediate administration of high-dose corticosteroids",
      "Enforcing fasting and maintaining hydration with intravenous fluids",
      "Starting prophylactic antibiotics to prevent post-operative infections"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For potential surgical candidates, enforcing fasting and maintaining hydration with intravenous fluids are essential steps to prepare for surgery and minimize aspiration risk.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the preoperative preparations necessary to minimize risks associated with anesthesia and the surgical procedure itself."

    question: "A 65-year-old woman with cerebral atrophy falls at home and presents with a headache and fluctuating consciousness level. A CT scan shows an acute subdural hematoma. She has a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL. Which of the following conditions would most likely exacerbate her acute hemorrhage?",
    options: [
      "Anemia",
      "Hyperglycemia",
      "Leukocytosis",
      "Thrombocytosis",
      "Hypothyroidism"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Anemia can exacerbate acute hemorrhages by reducing the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity and contributing to tissue hypoxia, which may worsen the patient's clinical condition.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the systemic conditions that can impact the severity of a hemorrhage and the brain's ability to tolerate an injury."
