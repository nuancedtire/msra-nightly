# Frontotemporal Dementia: An Overview

## Introduction

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurological disorder resulting from the degeneration of the brain's frontal and temporal lobes. This condition often runs in families and is associated with mutations in three specific genes:

- **C9ORF72**
- **MAPT** (tau protein gene)
- **PGRN** (progranulin protein gene)

Individuals with mutations in these genes have a significant risk of passing the condition on to their offspring and siblings, with a 50% chance of inheritance. Notably, those with mutations in the tau and progranulin protein genes, both located on chromosome 17, are highly likely to develop FTD. However, FTD development is not guaranteed for individuals with C9ORF72 gene mutations. The usual onset of FTD occurs in the mid-50s, with a prognosis ranging from 3 to 21 years.

## Clinical Presentation

FTD manifests through a variety of symptoms, including:

- Memory loss
- Personality changes
- Impaired language abilities and word knowledge
- Increased impulsivity and inappropriate behavior
- Compulsions or ritualistic behavior
- Altered appetite and food preferences
- Parkinsonism symptoms (in up to 50% of cases)

## Diagnosis

FTD is diagnosed based on:

- Patient history
- Physical examination
- Brain imaging findings

### Investigations

When FTD is suspected, the following steps are recommended:

- **Brain Imaging:** A CT or MRI scan, with MRI being the preferred method, will usually reveal asymmetrical atrophy in the frontal and/or temporal lobes.
- **Cognitive Testing:** Tools like the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) gauge FTD progression.

It's also crucial to rule out conditions that mimic FTD with these tests:

- Full blood count (FBC) for anaemia
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) for inflammatory conditions
- Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 for hyperthyroidism
- Urea and Electrolytes (U&Es) for renal failure and electrolyte imbalances
- Liver function tests (LFTs) for liver failure
- Serum B12 levels for megaloblastic/pernicious anaemia
- HIV test
- Serum folate levels
- Syphilis serology

## Management

### Prescribing Approaches

While there's no cure for FTD, the following medications can manage its symptoms:

- Benzodiazepines for aggression or agitation
- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for compulsions
- Valproate semisodium for mood and impulsivity
- Topiramate to suppress appetite
- Antipsychotics for challenging behaviors

### Non-Prescribing Strategies

Education is vital for patients and caregivers to understand disease progression. Other non-pharmacological approaches include:

- Discussing Lasting Power of Attorney for health and finance early post-diagnosis
- Anticipating increased care needs and challenging behaviors
- Offering psychological support and respite care to family caregivers

**Tip:** Ensure legal and financial plans are in place while the patient can still participate in decision-making.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 58-year-old man presents with a 2-year history of progressive language difficulty, particularly with word-finding and object naming. He has a family history suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance of a neurodegenerative disorder. His physical examination is unremarkable, but his speech is halting and effortful. An MRI of the brain reveals asymmetric atrophy of the left temporal lobe. Which gene mutation is most likely associated with his condition?",
    options: [
      "C9ORF72",
      "MAPT",
      "PGRN",
      "APOE Îµ4",
      "SNCA"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Mutations in the MAPT gene, which encodes the tau protein, are associated with frontotemporal dementia and often present with language difficulties and asymmetric atrophy on brain imaging.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which gene mutations are specifically associated with hereditary frontotemporal dementia and the typical clinical presentation related to those mutations."
  },
  {
    question: "A 62-year-old woman is diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia after presenting with significant personality changes and compulsive behavior. Which medication might be most beneficial in managing her compulsions?",
    options: [
      "Benzodiazepines",
      "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)",
      "Valproate semisodium",
      "Topiramate",
      "Antipsychotics"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! SSRIs are often used to manage compulsions in patients with frontotemporal dementia.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about which medications are typically used to manage specific behavioral symptoms associated with frontotemporal dementia."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following investigations is not typically necessary to rule out other conditions when diagnosing frontotemporal dementia?",
    options: [
      "Full blood count (FBC)",
      "Electrolyte panel",
      "HIV test",
      "Serum folate levels",
      "Chest X-ray"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A chest X-ray is not typically necessary when diagnosing frontotemporal dementia, whereas the other listed investigations help rule out conditions with similar presentations.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which tests are relevant for ruling out other conditions that might present with similar symptoms to frontotemporal dementia."
  },
  {
    question: "A 55-year-old woman with frontotemporal dementia is experiencing increased aggression and agitation. Her family is concerned about her safety and the well-being of her caregivers. Which class of medication may be indicated to manage these symptoms?",
