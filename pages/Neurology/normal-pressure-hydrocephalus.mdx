# Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus Overview

Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is characterized by a clinical triad that includes gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence, alongside ventricular enlargement. This condition is often summarized by the mnemonic: wet (urinary incontinence), wacky (dementia), and wobbly (gait disturbance).

## Types of Hydrocephalus

Hydrocephalus can be classified into two primary types:

- **Communicating Hydrocephalus:**
  - Caused by reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption or increased CSF production.

- **Non-Communicating Hydrocephalus:**
  - Results from blockages in the pathways that allow CSF to exit the ventricles and enter the subarachnoid space.

Both types lead to increased intracranial pressure. However, NPH is a unique form of chronic communicating hydrocephalus where this increase in pressure is absent. NPH may develop secondary to conditions such as meningitis, head injuries, and subarachnoid hemorrhages.

## Epidemiology

NPH primarily affects individuals over 60 years old. Over time, CSF accumulates, causing the ventricles to dilate, which leads to the manifestation of the classic triad of symptoms associated with NPH.

## Diagnosis

- **Symptom Presentation:**
  - Approximately 60% of patients will exhibit the full triad at diagnosis.
  - Symptoms typically emerge gradually over several months.
  - Early signs include increased urgency and frequency of urination.
  - Gait disturbances, which may exacerbate incontinence, are characterized by ataxia with a broad-based stance and short steps.
  - Reversible dementia is often linked to these symptoms.
  - Unlike other forms of hydrocephalus, NPH patients usually do not show signs of increased intracerebral pressure.

## Investigations

It's crucial to exclude other cognitive disorders when diagnosing NPH and to evaluate vitamin B12 and thyroid function. 

- **Imaging:**
  - CT imaging typically reveals enlarged ventricles without corresponding sulcal enlargement.

- **CSF Tap Test:**
  - A normal or slightly elevated opening pressure is expected.
  - Post-extraction of CSF, an improvement in symptoms should be observed, which supports the diagnosis of NPH.

## Management

### Prescribing

- **Pharmacological Options:**
  - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) and diuretics can be used in some cases.
  
### Non-Prescribing

- **Definitive Therapy:**
  - Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is the primary treatment method, involving the drainage of excess CSF into the peritoneum.

**Warning:** Shunting procedures may lead to complications such as over-drainage, shunt infection, and under-drainage. Approximately 10% of patients may experience severe complications like seizures, hemorrhage, or infection post-shunt placement.

    question: "A 72-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of progressive difficulty walking, cognitive decline, and urinary urgency. He has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. His family reports that his gait disturbance initially started with unsteadiness and has now progressed to a broad-based stance with shuffling steps. His cognitive testing shows mild dementia, and a CT scan of the brain reveals enlarged ventricles with no significant sulcal enlargement. His opening CSF pressure is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's clinical presentation of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary symptoms (wet, wacky, wobbly) alongside imaging showing ventriculomegaly without sulcal enlargement, and normal CSF pressure is consistent with normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember the classic triad of NPH (wet, wacky, wobbly) and the imaging findings that distinguish it from other neurological conditions. Which condition fits this description?"

    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The CSF tap test, which involves a lumbar puncture and extraction of CSF, can lead to temporary improvement in the symptoms of NPH. This supports the diagnosis when combined with the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings.",
