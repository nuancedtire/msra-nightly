# Stroke: Classification, Diagnosis, and Management

Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. This article provides a comprehensive overview of stroke, including its classification, diagnosis, risk factors, and management strategies.

## Classification of Stroke

Stroke is defined by the sudden onset of neurological deficits persisting for at least **24 hours**. It is categorized into two main types:

- **Haemorrhagic Stroke:** Caused by the rupture of a cerebral blood vessel, leading to intracranial bleeding.
- **Ischaemic Stroke:** Resulting from occlusion or significant narrowing of cerebral blood vessels, comprising over 80% of stroke cases.

A **Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)** is characterized by neurological deficits that resolve within **24 hours**.

## Diagnosis

### Initial Assessment

Upon presentation, perform an **ABCDE assessment** and a detailed neurological examination. Symptoms vary according to the affected brain region.

### Bamford Classification

Ischaemic strokes are further classified based on the region impacted, using the **Bamford Classification**:

1. **Total Anterior Circulation Stroke (TACS)**
   - **Affected Area:** Cortex supplied by middle and anterior cerebral arteries
   - **Symptoms:** Must have all three:
     - Unilateral weakness or sensory deficit of face, arm, and leg
     - Homonymous hemianopia
     - Higher cerebral dysfunction (e.g., dysphasia, visuospatial disorder)

2. **Partial Anterior Circulation Stroke (PACS)**
   - **Affected Area:** Cortex supplied by anterior cerebral arteries
   - **Symptoms:** Any two of the TACS symptoms or higher cerebral dysfunction alone

3. **Posterior Circulation Syndrome (POCS)**
   - **Affected Area:** Cerebellum and brainstem
   - **Symptoms:** Includes cranial nerve palsy, bilateral motor/sensory deficit, conjugate eye movement disorder, cerebellar dysfunction, or isolated homonymous hemianopia

4. **Lacunar Stroke (LACS)**
   - **Affected Area:** Subcortical regions due to small vessel disease
   - **Symptoms:** No higher cerebral function loss, with one of the following:
     - Pure sensory stroke
     - Pure motor stroke
     - Sensori-motor stroke
     - Ataxic hemiparesis

### Risk Factors

#### Ischaemic Stroke Risk Factors

- Family history
- Smoking
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Advanced age
- Atrial fibrillation
- Carotid artery stenosis
- Hyperlipidaemia
- Sickle cell disease
- Hypercoagulopathies

#### Haemorrhagic Stroke Risk Factors

- Family history
- Hypertension
- Haemophilia
- Advanced age
- Alcohol abuse
- Anticoagulant use
- Vascular malformation
- Illicit sympathomimetic drug use
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy

#### TIA Risk Factors

- Family history
- Hypertension
- Smoking
- Atrial fibrillation
- Advanced age
- Valvular heart disease
- Diabetes
- Carotid artery stenosis
- Alcohol abuse

## Investigations

### For Ischaemic Strokes

- **First-line Investigations:**
  - Non-contrast head CT scan
  - Serum tests: Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, troponin, prothrombin time, INR (if applicable)
  - ECG

- **Additional Investigations:**
  - Serum toxicology screen
  - CT/MR angiography (for thrombectomy candidates)
  - Carotid ultrasound

## Management

### General Approach

Refer suspected strokes to a specialist stroke team for management in an acute stroke unit.

### Ischaemic Stroke

- **Thrombolysis:** Administer alteplase if within **4.5 hours** of symptom onset after excluding hemorrhage.
- **Thrombectomy:** Offer mechanical clot retrieval within **6 hours** or between **6 to 24 hours** for late-presenting strokes.
- **Aspirin:** Prescribe a high dose (300mg) within **24 hours**, followed by long-term antiplatelet therapy.
- **Gastroprotection:** Consider a protein pump inhibitor.
- **Rehabilitation:** Early mobilisation and input from physiotherapy, occupational, and speech and language therapy.
- **Nutrition:** Use nasogastric tubes for dysphagia, with a swallowing assessment as part of early management.

### Haemorrhagic Stroke

Management is supportive, with cautious blood pressure control. Rapid blood pressure lowering is considered for systolic blood pressure between **150 and 220 mmHg** within **6 hours**. Decisions should be individualized for other cases.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents with sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech. His blood pressure is 170/90 mmHg, and a non-contrast head CT scan shows no evidence of hemorrhage. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management step?",
    options: [
      "Immediate administration of alteplase",
      "Immediate lowering of blood pressure to 130/80 mmHg",
      "Initiation of high-dose aspirin therapy",
      "Carotid endarterectomy",
      "Insertion of a nasogastric tube for nutrition"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke, and since there is no evidence of hemorrhage on head CT, immediate administration of alteplase is appropriate if within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember the time-sensitive nature of certain interventions in stroke management. What immediate action should be taken for a patient with acute ischemic stroke symptoms and no hemorrhage on imaging?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old woman presents with acute onset of isolated left homonymous hemianopia. Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and previous myocardial infarction. A non-contrast head CT scan is negative for hemorrhage. Based on the Bamford Classification, which type of ischemic stroke is she most likely experiencing?",

      "Lacunar Stroke (LACS)",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Isolated homonymous hemianopia is indicative of a Posterior Circulation Syndrome (POCS), which involves the cerebellum and brainstem.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the symptom described and its relation to cerebral vascular territories. Which Bamford Classification corresponds with the affected brain region and presenting symptom?"
