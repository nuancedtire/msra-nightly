# Turner Syndrome Overview

Turner syndrome is one of the most common chromosomal disorders, characterized by the sporadic loss of a sex chromosome, affecting only females (`45X0`). The syndrome can either be complete (an X chromosome is completely missing) or mosaic (where in most cells, one X chromosome is complete, but the other is partly missing). Turner syndrome is estimated to affect around 1 in 2,000-2,500 live female births.

## Diagnosis

Patients with the syndrome can develop a wide variety of features, such as:

- **Premature ovarian failure** (due to gonadal dysgenesis) potentially resulting in failure to reach puberty
- **Short stature**
- **Infertility**
- **Heart anomalies** 
  - Bicuspid aortic valve
  - Coarctation of the aorta
- **Kidney malformations** 
  - Horseshoe kidney
  - Renal agenesis, potentially causing recurrent UTIs and hypertension
- **Learning disabilities**
- **Physical features**
  - Short neck with a webbed appearance
  - Broad chest and widely spaced nipples (shield chest)
- **Dermatological**
  - Pigmented nevi
- **Auditory problems**
  - Hearing loss
  - Recurrent otitis media
- **Additional features**
  - Low hairline
  - Eye problems (strabismus, amblyopia, and cataracts)

## Investigations

Most cases of Turner syndrome are diagnosed in early childhood; however, some can be missed until adulthood or even altogether. The syndrome should be suspected in girls with an unknown cause of short stature.

Screening for the syndrome can be performed by a maternal blood sample, with definitive testing done at `10-12 weeks` with either chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis. Ultrasound can also be used to diagnose characteristic features like cystic hygroma, thick neck tissue, lymphoedema, and small fetal size. Clinical diagnosis of Turner syndrome should also be confirmed via karyotyping, often done via a blood sample. Postnatally, MRI can be used to identify any structural abnormalities, e.g., renal or cardiac. Affected patients should receive thyroid testing due to the risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease. Additionally, auditory exams should routinely take place, especially for children, to prevent delayed speech and cognitive development.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

The treatment of Turner syndrome is very specific towards individuals and their specific symptoms. Treatment requires the input of:

- Surgeons
- Pediatricians
- Endocrinologists
- Ophthalmologists
- Psychologists

There is currently no cure for Turner syndrome. However, therapies have been developed to improve quality of life and physical development. Some patients with Turner syndrome can benefit from **growth hormone therapy**. Additionally, **sex hormone replacement therapy** to undergo puberty and normal development can be used and continued until menopause. Most patients with Turner syndrome remain infertile; however, **IVF has shown to be possible** in some patients.

<summary>Extended Management Options</summary>

- **Growth Hormone Therapy:** Often recommended to increase height potential.
- **Sex Hormone Therapy:** Helps initiate secondary sexual development.
- **Psychosocial Support:** Important due to potential learning difficulties or social challenges.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 10-year-old girl is evaluated for short stature and lack of pubertal development. She is found to have hypertension and recurrent UTIs. Which of the following investigations would most likely confirm the diagnosis of Turner syndrome?",
    options: [
      "Bone age assessment",
      "Serum hormone levels",
      "Karyotype analysis",
      "Abdominal ultrasound",
      "Thyroid function test"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Karyotype analysis is definitive for diagnosing Turner syndrome by identifying the chromosomal pattern typically associated with the condition (45X0 or mosaicism).",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder. What test would directly identify the chromosomal anomaly typical in Turner syndrome?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following cardiovascular anomalies is most commonly associated with Turner syndrome?",
    options: [
      "Tetralogy of Fallot",
      "Bicuspid aortic valve",
      "Patent ductus arteriosus",
      "Coarctation of the pulmonary artery",
      "Ventricular septal defect"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Bicuspid aortic valve is commonly associated with Turner syndrome, along with coarctation of the aorta.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the key cardiovascular features often screened for in individuals with Turner syndrome. Think about aortic valve defects."
  },
  {
    question: "Despite no cure for Turner syndrome, which therapeutic option has shown to improve quality of life by addressing the common issues related to growth?",
    options: [
      "Behavioral therapy",
      "Stem cell transplantation",
      "Growth hormone therapy",
      "Gene therapy",
      "Insulin therapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Growth hormone therapy is often used to improve height potential and physical development in Turner syndrome.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the therapy that directly targets the short stature commonly seen in patients with Turner syndrome. It involves a hormonal approach."
  },
  {
    question: "A 16-year-old with Turner syndrome is undergoing regular follow-ups. Which screening is particularly important to prevent delayed speech and cognitive development?",
