# Achondroplasia: A Clinical Overview

Achondroplasia is a **genetic condition** resulting from a gain-of-function mutation in the **Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3** (_FGFR3_) gene. It affects the growth of cartilaginous bone tissue, leading to disproportionate short stature with an average adult height of 4 feet. This condition is inherited in an **autosomal dominant** fashion, with a 50% chance of transmission from an affected individual to their offspring. Approximately 80% of cases arise from spontaneous mutations, occurring in about 1 in 20,000 live births.

## Diagnosis

Achondroplasia can be identified through routine ultrasound scans during pregnancy, typically in the third trimester. Indicators of achondroplasia during fetal ultrasound include:

- **Physical Characteristics:**
  - Short hands with wide fingers
  - Narrow trunk
  - Shortened proximal long bones (_rhizomelic shortening_)
  - **Head Deformities:**
    - Large head
    - Frontal bossing (_prominent forehead_)
    - Hypoplastic midface

**Postnatal Signs:**

- Hip abduction when lying flat
- Mild hypotonia due to spinal cord compression
- Hypermobility, except reduced movement in elbows

Cognitive and sexual functions are **typically unaffected**, though motor development delays can be present. Growth milestones include holding head up by 7 months, crawling by 10 months, sitting unsupported by 11 months, and walking unaided by 22 months.

## Investigations

**Clinical Examination:** 
- Diagnosis may be achieved through serial fetal ultrasound scans or post-birth examinations. 

**DNA Testing:**
- Used when both parents have achondroplasia to ascertain homozygous inheritance, which is more severe.
- Focuses on the 'classical 1138 mutation' of the _FGFR3_ gene.
- Wider sequencing for differential diagnosis (hypochondroplasia vs. achondroplasia).

**Skeletal Survey:**
- X-rays are crucial to identify signs:
  - Increased interpedicular distances in vertebrae
  - Shortened proximal long bones (femur and humerus)
  - Metaphysis changes
  - Brachydactyly (_short fingers_)
  - 'Trident' finger appearance
  - Widened epiphyses
  - Pelvic abnormalities
  - Skull Findings:
    - Larger cranium
    - Reduced foramen magnum size

## Management (Prescribing)

**Growth Hormones:** 
- Trials have yielded minimal success in long-term height increase, despite early growth spurts.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Achondroplasia lacks a cure; management focuses on complication treatment:

- **Common Complications:**
  - Hydrocephalus
  - Foramen magnum compression
  - Sleep apnoea (early life due to cord compression and later due to airway narrowing)

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
**Note:** Children with sleep apnoea may require ENT evaluation for tonsil/adenoid removal.
</Callout>

- **Additional Issues:**
  - Tibial bowing (surgical correction)
  - Repeated otitis media
  - Hearing loss
  - Obesity (prevention through lifestyle advice)

**Therapeutic Interventions:**

- **Physiotherapy:** For motor delays.
- **Occupational Therapy:** Adaptation for daily life with shortened stature.

Some opt for surgical limb lengthening, which can increase height by 15-30cm. Consideration includes potential complications such as poor wound healing, nerve damage and long recovery periods in orthopedic casts. Newer methods involve external fixators and magnets, although these are not without risks.

**Obstetric Consideration:**
- Caesarean sections may be advised due to potential for cephalopelvic disproportion.

<summary>Surgical Interventions Detail</summary>

- Surgery involves bone breaking and stretching, posing risks of complications:
  - Wound healing issues
  - Nerve and vessel damage due to stretching
- New techniques using external fixators and magnets show promise but can still result in nerve damage and poor bone growth.
