# Huntingtonâ€™s Disease: An Overview

Huntingtonâ€™s disease, also known as **Huntingtonâ€™s chorea**, is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that results in the death of brain cells within the basal ganglia and cortex. It is a progressive and incurable condition, usually fatal after onset over a period of 20 years. The most common cause of death is from intercurrent illness such as pneumonia, with suicide being the second most common.

## Genetic

- **Autosomal dominant**: Huntington's disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
- **Trinucleotide repeat disorder**: Involves an increase in the length of cysteine-adenosine-guanine (`CAG`) repeated in the `huntingtin` (HTT) gene located on chromosome 4p16.3.
- **Anticipation**: The disease may present at an earlier age in successive generations.
- Results in degeneration of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the striatum (caudate nucleus) of the basal ganglia.

## Diagnosis

The prevalence of Huntingtonâ€™s disease is approximately between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 20,000. Being the most common inherited neurodegenerative disorder, it typically occurs between 30 and 50 years of age but can manifest at any age.

- Symptoms may begin before the age of 20, often when inherited from the father.
- Causes Parkinsonian features, dystonia, pyramidal tract signs, dementia, and epilepsy.
- Chorea is often mild or absent.
- May involve learning difficulties and behavioral disturbances at school.

### Clinical Characteristics

Huntingtonâ€™s disease is characterized by a triad of symptoms: motor, cognitive, and psychiatric.

- **Motor Symptoms**
  - Chorea
  - Dystonia (notably saccadic eye movements)
  - Incoordination
  
- **Cognitive Impairment**
  
- **Psychiatric and Behavioral Difficulties**
  - **Depression**: Significantly higher in `HTT` gene carriers.
  - Personality changes (e.g., irritability, apathy, depression*)
  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder, agitation, poor self-care, judgment, and inflexibility.

### Stages of Presentation

- **Prodromal phase**: Mild psychotic and behavioral symptoms.
- **Early features**: Personality changes, self-neglect, apathy, clumsiness, fleeting grimaces.
- With progression: Onset of chorea, rigidity, dementia; often associated with seizures.
- At later stages: Chorea replaced by dystonia and Parkinsonian features. May also include spasticity, clonus, and extensor plantar responses.

**Note:** Patients may also develop Huntingtonâ€™s disease-related cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle wasting.

## Investigations

- **Imaging**: MRI and CT may demonstrate a loss of striatal volume and increased size of frontal horns of lateral ventricles in moderate-to-severe cases, though early stage scans are often unhelpful.
- **Genetic Testing**: Extensive genetic counseling required, usually conducted in specialized units. It can confirm presence of genetic mutation but not the onset of the disease.
- **Differential Testing**: Includes testing for thyroid disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (`SLE`), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and Wilsonâ€™s disease.

## Management (Prescribing)

While no drug can halt progression, symptomatic treatments are available:

1. **Chorea**: 
   - Benzodiazepines
   - Sodium valproate
   - Dopamine-depleting agents (e.g., tetrabenazine)
   - Dopaminergic stabilisers (e.g., pridopidine)
  
2. **Bradykinesia and Rigidity**: 
   - Levodopa
   - Dopamine agonists

3. **Depression**: 
   - SSRIs are first-line antidepressants.
   - Refractory cases may require electroconvulsive therapy (`ECT`).

4. **Psychosis**: 
   - Antipsychotics, preferably atypical due to lower extrapyramidal side effects.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

A multidisciplinary team approach is essential, involving:

- **Specialists**: Neurology, general practice, psychiatry, clinical genetics, neuropsychology, dietetics, social work, and palliative care.
- **Therapists**: Speech and language for communication and feeding issues; physiotherapists for balance and movement; occupational therapists to assist with daily tasks.
- **Psychotherapy and Behavioral Strategies**: For obsessive-compulsive behaviors and irritability. Antipsychotics may be needed if these strategies fail.
- **Deep Brain Stimulation**: A recommended approach for palliative treatment of dystonia, stiffness, and choreatic movements.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old patient with a family history of Huntington's disease presents with clumsiness and mild chorea. Genetic testing confirms an increase in CAG repeats in the HTT gene. Which area of the brain is primarily affected in Huntingtonâ€™s disease?",
    options: [
      "Frontal lobe",
      "Amygdala",
      "Basal ganglia",
      "Cerebellum"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Huntington's disease primarily affects the basal ganglia, particularly the degeneration of the striatum (caudate nucleus), which includes the cholinergic and GABAergic neurons.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember, Huntington's disease affects regions involved in movement and coordination. Consider the symptoms such as chorea and where these would originate in the brain."
  },
  {
    question: "In which of the following patterns is Huntingtonâ€™s disease inherited?",
    options: [
      "Autosomal recessive",
      "X-linked recessive",
      "Mitochondrial inheritance",
      "Autosomal dominant"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Huntington's disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning only one copy of the mutated gene is necessary to develop the disorder.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the implications for family history when a disorder is autosomal dominant. How are traits passed down when only one parent must be affected to pass it to offspring?"
  },

      "Epilepsy",
      "Mild chorea",
      "Parkinsonian features",
      "Substantial weight gain"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Substantial weight gain is not a characteristic feature of juvenile Huntington's disease, which often presents with weight loss and muscle wasting.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about how juvenile Huntington's disease might differ from adult-onset in its presentation, considering symptoms like movement and cognitive features."
  },
  {
    question: "After confirming a diagnosis of Huntington's disease, which multidisciplinary team member would be most appropriate to address the patient's psychiatric symptoms?",
