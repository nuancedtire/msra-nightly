# Sickle Cell Anaemia: An Overview

Sickle cell anaemia (HbS) is a genetic disorder caused by a single base mutation that swaps glutamine for valine at position 6 in the beta-globin chain. This mutated beta globin produces HbS instead of HbA.

## Genetic Inheritance

The disease follows an **autosomal recessive** inheritance pattern. Offspring of affected individuals can inherit one of three syndromes:

- **Unaffected (AA)**: Normal hemoglobin.
- **Heterozygous (AS - trait)**: Intermediate symptoms, often without severe manifestations.
- **Homozygous (SS)**: Known as sickle cell anaemia, the most severe form.

*Note:* The heterozygous trait is prevalent in Africa due to its protective effect against malaria. About 10% of the Afro-Caribbean population in the UK are trait carriers.

### Pathophysiology

HbSS red blood cells can become rigid and **sickle** due to polymerization of HbS. This is often triggered by:

- Hypoxia
- Cold
- Dehydration
- Acidosis

Consequences include reduced life span of red blood cells and obstruction in microcirculation, leading to ischaemia.

## Diagnosis

Patients with sickle cell anaemia often experience multiple hospital admissions due to **acute crises** or chronic disease complications, such as:

- **Severe bone pain**
- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Chronic lung disease in 30-40% of patients
- **Anaemia**: Due to chronic haemolysis
- **Avascular necrosis**: Vaso-occlusive crises affect bones
- **Infections**: Particularly in the lungs and kidneys
- **Leg ulcers:** Results from microvascular occlusion
- **Cardiac complications**: Includes cardiomegaly and arrhythmias
- **Neurological abnormalities**: Occurring in 25% of patients
- **Pigmented gallstones**
- **Chronic hepatomegaly**
- **Kidney involvement**: Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis
- **Retinopathy**
- **Atrophic spleen**: Repeated infarctions lead to high sepsis rates

### Investigations

- **Heel-prick test**: Conducted at 5-9 days after birth for initial screening.
- **Haemoglobin electrophoresis**: Used to differentiate forms of sickle cell syndrome upon a positive screening test.
- **Family history and clinical signs**: Help in diagnosis in older children and adults.

## Acute Crises Management

Acute crises in sickle cell patients can be categorized as:

1. **Thrombotic/Vaso-occlusive crises**: Extremely painful, triggered by dehydration, infection, or hypoxia. Leads to ischaemia in various organs.
2. **Aplastic**: Caused by parvovirus infection leading to bone marrow failure and reduced hemoglobin.
3. **Haemolytic**: Rarely occurs due to increased haemolysis.
4. **Acute chest syndrome**: Primary cause of mortality after childhood; requires emergency red cell exchange.
5. **Sequestration**: Sickling in organs like lungs and spleen leads to hypovolemia and possible death.

**Treatment:**

- Analgesia
- Supplementary oxygen
- Blood transfusion
- Rehydration
- Antibiotics for infections

## Long-term Management

Patients are often treated with:

- **Hydroxyurea**: Elevates fetal hemoglobin levels, reducing sickling and crisis frequency.
- **Vaccination**: Includes pneumococcal and flu vaccines to prevent infections.

  {
    question: "A 5-day-old infant is undergoing a routine screening test and is found to have sickle cell trait. Which method is most appropriate for confirming the diagnosis of this condition?",
    options: [
      "Genetic sequencing of the beta-globin gene",
      "Complete blood count and reticulocyte count",
      "Haemoglobin electrophoresis",
      "Peripheral blood smear examination"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Haemoglobin electrophoresis is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of sickle cell disease or trait, as it can differentiate between HbA, HbS, and other hemoglobin variants.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the common methods used to differentiate between different forms of hemoglobin. Which technique enables precise identification of hemoglobin variants in affected individuals?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 23-year-old woman with sickle cell anaemia presents with sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea. A chest x-ray shows infiltrates, and her oxygen saturation is 85% on room air. What is the most appropriate immediate management?",
    options: [
      "Non-invasive ventilation",
      "Red cell exchange transfusion",
      "Antibiotics and bronchodilators",
      "Intravenous corticosteroids"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Acute chest syndrome is a common and severe complication of sickle cell disease, often requiring emergency red cell exchange to rapidly reduce sickling and improve oxygenation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the potential acute complications of sickle cell anaemia affecting the lungs, particularly those requiring urgent intervention to prevent mortality."

  {
    question: "Which of the following triggers can lead to vaso-occlusive crises in patients with sickle cell anaemia?",
    options: [
      "Exposure to high altitude",
      "Hyperventilation",
      "Use of beta-blockers",
      "Overhydration"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Hypoxia, which can occur during exposure to high altitudes, is a known trigger for vaso-occlusive crises due to increased polymerization of HbS.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider factors that can lead to increased sickling of red blood cells in sickle cell patients. Focus on conditions that might cause hypoxia or stress to the RBCs."

  {
    question: "A 30-year-old man with sickle cell disease presents with anemia, profound fatigue, and pallor. A blood test shows a low reticulocyte count. Which complication is most consistent with these findings?",
    options: [
      "Thrombotic crisis",
      "Aplastic crisis",
      "Haemolytic crisis",
      "Sequestration crisis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An aplastic crisis is characterized by a sudden cessation of erythropoiesis, often due to parvovirus B19 infection, resulting in a low reticulocyte count in patients already dependent on a high turnover of red cells.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Focus on the combination of anemia and low reticulocyte count. Consider what might decrease the production of new red blood cells in this setting."
