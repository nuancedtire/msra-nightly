# Patau Syndrome (Trisomy 13)

Patau syndrome, also known as **trisomy 13**, is a genetic disorder where all or part of chromosome 13 appears three times instead of twice in cells. The syndrome is more common in females than males and occurs in roughly 1 in 5,000-12,000 live births. Patau syndrome is associated with 1% of all miscarriages and has higher rates of pre-eclampsia. It has extremely low survival rates, with 50% of infants dying within the first week of life and 90% by the end of infancy.

In most cases, the duplication of chromosome 13 in children with Patau syndrome is due to *de novo* errors during meiosis. **Advanced parental age** is the biggest risk factor. 20% of trisomy 13 mutations result from translocation involving chromosome 13 and another chromosome. In about 5% of cases, only a percentage of cells contain the additional 13th chromosome, known as *mosaicism*. These children tend to have less severe symptoms.

## Diagnosis

Certain features in Patau syndrome can be present at birth including:

- **Facial clefting**
- **IUGR (Intrauterine Growth Retardation)**
- **Holoprosencephaly**, potentially with cyclopia and severe mental deficiency
- **Microcephaly**
- **Polydactyly** (extra fingers or toes)
- **Rocker-bottom feet**
- **Neural tube defects**
- **Heart defects** such as ASD, VSD, and PDA
- **Renal defects**
- **Omphalocoele** (abdominal wall defect)
- **Cutis aplasia** (areas of missing skin)
- **Cryptorchidism** (undescended testicles)

## Investigations

Screening for Patau syndrome, along with Down's and Edward's syndrome, occurs at 10-14 weeks of pregnancy through blood tests and ultrasound. Ultrasound may show findings like **holoprosencephaly**, **polydactyly**, and **growth retardation**. Diagnostic tests include **amniocentesis** and **chorionic villus sampling** if screening tests show high risk.

Postnatally, Patau syndrome can be diagnosed via clinical testing, identifying characteristic physical findings, and DNA analysis. Trisomy 13 infants may sometimes have persistent fetal hemoglobin that does not change to adult hemoglobin gradually.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Management of Patau syndrome is largely supportive and depends on individual symptoms. Surgery can correct some abnormalities, such as a cleft lip/palate or heart defects, based on severity.

<summary>Additional Supportive Care</summary>

- **Multidisciplinary Team Involvement**: Due to the wide range of possible symptoms, a multi-disciplinary team approach is essential.
  - **Social Services**
  - **Physiotherapy**
  - **Genetic Counselling**

Families of infants with Patau syndrome can greatly benefit from these support services.

    question: "A newborn is diagnosed with Patau syndrome. Which of the following genetic mechanisms is most commonly responsible for this condition?",
    options: [
      "Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 13",
      "De novo errors during meiosis leading to nondisjunction",
      "Mosaicism with some cells having an extra chromosome 13",
      "Uniparental disomy of chromosome 13"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! De novo errors during meiosis that result in nondisjunction are the most common cause of Patau syndrome, leading to an extra chromosome 13 in each cell of the child.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Patau syndrome is primarily caused by an error during meiosis leading to an extra chromosome 13, rather than structural chromosomal rearrangements or post-zygotic events. Consider the most common genetic errors during meiosis."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following features is NOT typically associated with Patau syndrome?",
    options: [
      "Holoprosencephaly",
      "Polydactyly",
      "Facial clefting",
      "Café-au-lait spots"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Café-au-lait spots are not typically associated with Patau syndrome. They are more commonly linked to neurofibromatosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the features commonly associated with Patau syndrome, which often include severe midline defects and limb abnormalities. Café-au-lait spots are not one of these typical features."

  {
    question: "Which prenatal diagnostic test may provide confirmation of a high suspicion of Patau syndrome during pregnancy?",
    options: [
      "Ultrasound",
      "Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT)",
      "Amniocentesis",
      "Quad screen"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Amniocentesis can provide definitive confirmation of genetic disorders like Patau syndrome through karyotyping or DNA analysis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While screening tests can suggest an increased risk, amniocentesis is a diagnostic test that provides a confirmed diagnosis by examining the actual chromosomes."

    question: "A 3-day-old infant with Patau syndrome presents with difficulty breathing and cyanosis. Which congenital heart defect is most likely to be found in this infant?",
    options: [
      "Tetralogy of Fallot",
      "Atrial septal defect",
      "Complete atrioventricular canal",

    correctFeedback: "Correct! An atrial septal defect is one of the heart anomalies frequently associated with Patau syndrome, alongside ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the specific heart defects that are commonly associated with Patau syndrome. Think about defects that may result in left-to-right shunts."
