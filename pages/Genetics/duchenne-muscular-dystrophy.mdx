# Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an **X-linked, degenerative disease** caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, located on the small arm of the X chromosome. It is the most common and rapidly progressive type among muscular dystrophies. In the UK, DMD affects approximately 1 in 3000-3500 live births.

- **Inheritance Risk**:
  - Female carriers have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to sons, who will be affected.
  - There is a 50% risk that daughters will be carriers.

## Diagnosis

**Symptom Onset**: Children typically exhibit symptoms by age 3.

- **Common Symptoms**:
  - Delay in motor development (sitting unaided by 6-9 months, walking around 18 months)
  - Waddling gait
  - Calf hypertrophy
  - **Gower’s Sign**: Difficulty rising to stand due to proximal hip weakness, using hands to "crawl" up the body.

- **Additional Signs**:
  - Reduced muscle tone
  - Decreased reflexes

**Diagnostic Tests**:

1. **Blood Test**:
   - Elevated Creatinine Kinase (CK) levels.
2. **Confirmation**:
   - Muscle biopsy
   - Genetic testing

DMD is a progressive disorder with an average life expectancy of around 30 years. Patients experience muscle weakness, atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure. Most children require a wheelchair by ages 10-14 and rely on ventilatory support as the disease progresses.

<details>
<summary>Impact on Quality of Life</summary>

- Slower and less steady movement in school-aged children
- Scoliosis in the majority of cases
- Learning difficulties (affecting about a third of patients)
- Dependence on feeding support when swallowing becomes difficult

</details>

## Investigations

- **Initial Test**: Serum Creatinine Kinase (CK) levels.
  - CK levels are typically 50-100 times the normal value in DMD patients.
  
- **Genetic Testing**: Detection of a mutation on the X chromosome (Xp21 region).
  - **Negative Result**: Genetic analysis of the mother and any siblings.
  - **Further Confirmation**: Muscle biopsy if genetic testing is inconclusive.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Corticosteroids**: Useful in ambulant children with DMD to maintain mobility and delay scoliosis.
  - **Side Effects**: Weight gain, osteoporosis, delayed puberty, and growth
- **Ataluren**: Recommended for children over 5 with a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene.
  - Shown to extend walking ability and improve quality of life.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Physiotherapy**: Vital for muscle strengthening and contracture prevention.
- **Surgical Intervention**: May be necessary to correct scoliosis.
- **Ventilatory Support**: Usage of CPAP or non-invasive ventilation.
- **Nutritional Assistance**: Required if swallowing ability declines.
- **Psychological Support**: Important for the child and their family.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the clinic with concerns about his motor development. His parents report that he walked at 18 months and often uses his hands to push himself up from the floor. Physical examination reveals calf muscle hypertrophy and a waddling gait. Which initial diagnostic test is most appropriate for confirming the suspected condition?",
    options: [
      "Serum Creatinine Kinase (CK) levels",
      "Muscle biopsy",
      "Genetic testing for dystrophin mutation",
      "Electromyography (EMG)",
      "MRI of the spine"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presentation is suggestive of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and the initial test to confirm this suspicion is measuring serum Creatinine Kinase (CK) levels, which are typically elevated.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the hallmark features of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy presented in this scenario, focusing on an easily accessible and non-invasive test that would show elevated levels in muscle deterioration."
  },
  {
    question: "A boy diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is now 9 years old. Which management strategy is primarily aimed at prolonging his ability to walk and delaying scoliosis?",
    options: [
      "Ventilatory support",
      "Corticosteroid therapy",
      "Physiotherapy",
      "Nutritional assistance",
      "Surgical intervention for scoliosis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Corticosteroid therapy is essential in children with DMD to prolong ambulation and delay the onset of scoliosis by preserving muscle strength.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about which treatment is known for its role in prolonging mobility and delaying skeletal complications in DMD patients."
  },
  {
    question: "Which genetic phenomenon explains why females can be carriers of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy but are typically asymptomatic?",
    options: [
      "Random X-chromosome inactivation",
      "Mitochondrial inheritance",
      "Autosomal dominant inheritance",
      "Incomplete penetrance",
      "Germline mosaicism"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Random X-chromosome inactivation (Lyonization) means that in each female carrier, one of the X chromosomes is randomly inactivated. This often allows females to be symptom-free carriers of X-linked diseases like DMD.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Recall the genetic basis of DMD and why females, despite having the mutation, typically do not express symptoms due to inactivation mechanisms."
  },
  {
    question: "A mother of a boy with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is concerned about the risk to her future children. What is the probability of her having another child affected by DMD if she is a carrier?",
    options: [
      "100% for sons, 0% for daughters",
      "50% for sons, 50% for daughters",
      "25% for sons, 25% for daughters",
      "75% for sons, 25% for daughters",
      "50% for sons, 0% for daughters"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! As an X-linked recessive condition, a carrier mother has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to her sons (who will be affected) and a 50% chance of passing it to her daughters (who will be carriers).",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the inheritance pattern of X-linked disorders and how this affects the probability of passing the condition on to children."
