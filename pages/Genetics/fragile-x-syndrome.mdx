# Fragile X Syndrome: An Overview

## Introduction

**Fragile X syndrome** is an X-linked dominant genetic condition primarily affecting development, with significant impact on **cognitive impairment** and **learning disabilities**. The syndrome stems from a mutation in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes the protein **FMRP**, crucial for synapse development.

- **Prevalence:**
  - Affects 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females.
  - More prevalent in males; the majority exhibit intellectual disabilities.
  - Associated with conditions like **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**, **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**, and anxiety.

<summary>Physical and Behavioral Features</summary>

- **Physical Characteristics:**
  - Prominent ears
  - Macrocephaly
  - Long face
  - Large testes (post-puberty in males)
  - Excessive shyness (notably in females)

- **Seizures:**
  - Occur in around 15% of males and 5% of females.

</details>

## Diagnosis

**Genetic testing** through DNA analysis is the primary tool for diagnosing Fragile X syndrome. The condition is marked by a **trinucleotide repeat expansion** in the FMR1 gene.

- **Repeat Categories:**
  - `Up to 45 repeats`: No phenotype expression.
  - `55 to 200 repeats`: Designated as a â€˜pre-mutationâ€™.
  - `More than 200 repeats`: Strong likelihood of intellectual disability.
  
- **Carrier Transmission:**
  - Males with a â€˜pre-mutationâ€™ may not show symptoms but can pass the mutation to daughters, who become carriers.

**Note:** Fragile X syndrome can be detected prenatally if the mother is a known carrier via amniocentesis.

## Investigations

Genetic testing is the definitive investigation for diagnosing Fragile X syndrome. Additional assessments may be conducted for related conditions such as ADHD and ASD.

## Management

### Pharmacological

Currently, no specific medications target Fragile X syndrome. However, symptoms of associated ADHD can be managed with **methylphenidate**.

### Non-Pharmacological

- **Intellectual Support:**
  - Support strategies focus on enhancing independence and functional capabilities.
  - Tailored educational programs and therapy may aid in daily living skills.
