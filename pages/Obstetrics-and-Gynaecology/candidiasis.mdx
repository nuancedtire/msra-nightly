# Candidiasis: Overview, Diagnosis, and Management

Candidiasis is a common fungal infection caused by various Candida species, with *Candida albicans* being the most prevalent. Although candidiasis typically manifests in superficial locations such as the oropharyngeal cavity, skin, and genital areas, it can result in systemic infections, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems.

## Candidiasis and Its Causes

Candida species naturally inhabit the body's flora in areas like the oropharyngeal cavity, skin, gastrointestinal (GI), and genitourinary tracts. Under certain conditions, an overgrowth of Candida can lead to infections.

### Risk Factors for Candidiasis

- **Immunosuppression**:
  - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
  - Diabetes
  - Neonates
  - Neutropenia

- **Local Flora Imbalance**:
  - Increased oestrogen levels during pregnancy
  - Antibiotic or steroid use
  - Skin conditions causing excessive moisture or damage

### Progression to Systemic Infections

Local infections stem from an imbalance in native flora, which prompts Candida overgrowth and infection. Systemic infections often begin as local infections that breach mucosal barriers, leading to bloodstream invasion (candidaemia), tissue infections, and ultimately affecting vital organs.

## Diagnosis of Candidiasis

Identifying candidiasis involves recognizing various presentations depending on the infection site.

### Skin Infections

- Manifest as erythematous satellite lesions in warm, moist areas like the groin.
- Seen as nappy dermatitis in infants, peaking around 3 months of age.

### Oral Thrush (Pseudomembranous Candidiasis)

- Characterized by white plaques in the mouth, removable to reveal bleeding surfaces.
- Symptoms include loss of taste, pain during eating, or a cottony mouth sensation.

### Candida Oesophagitis

- Common in patients with AIDS or hematological malignancies.
- Symptoms include odynophagia, often with concurrent oral thrush.

### Vulvovaginitis

- Identified by white, crumbly, odourless discharge and vulvar itching.
- May be related to recent antibiotic use and typically presents with a vaginal pH of 4-4.5.

### Systemic Infections

Systemic candidiasis presents with signs of sepsis, including:

- Fever
- Skin rash
- Headache
- Neurological deficits
- Indications of organ infiltration, such as meningitis or endocarditis.

## Investigations for Candidiasis

Candidiasis is primarily diagnosed through clinical evaluation. However, additional tests may include:

- **Potassium Hydroxide Smear**:
  - Reveals budding hyphae or yeasts.
- **Culture Tests**:
  - Blood or tissue cultures may show Candida antigens.
- **Endoscopy**:
  - Performed when oesophageal candidiasis is suspected.

## Management of Candidiasis

### Prescribing Treatments

- **Skin Infections**:
  - Topical antifungals like clotrimazole or ketoconazole for 7-14 days.
- **Vaginal Yeast Infections**:
  - Similar topical antifungals or a single oral dose of fluconazole.
- **Oral Candidiasis**:
  - Topical nystatin or oral fluconazole as first-line treatments, with intraconazole or voriconazole as alternatives.
- **Oesophageal Candidiasis**:
  - Oral or IV fluconazole for 14-21 days.
- **Systemic Infections**:
  - IV caspofungin or micafungin for at least 2 weeks post-symptoms. Fluconazole for non-critically ill patients.

### Non-Prescribing Measures

For patients with vulvovaginitis:

- Avoid local irritants such as harsh soaps.
- Maintain vulvar skin health with mild emollients.

**Note:** Management strategies for candidiasis should be tailored to the specific type and location of the infection, as well as the patient's overall health and risk factors.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes presents with a thick, white, crumbly vaginal discharge and intense pruritus. She has recently completed a course of antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?",
    options: [
      "Oral metronidazole",
      "Topical clotrimazole",
      "Oral fluconazole",
      "IV caspofungin",
      "Topical terbinafine"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient is presenting with vulvovaginal candidiasis, likely due to recent antibiotic use disrupting her vaginal flora. Topical antifungals like clotrimazole are usually the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the symptoms and recent history of antibiotic use suggestive of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Which antifungal treatment is suitable for this localized infection?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old man with advanced HIV infection presents with painful swallowing and white plaques in his mouth that can be scraped off to reveal erythematous bases. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?",
    options: [
      "Topical nystatin",
      "Oral fluconazole",
      "IV amphotericin B",
      "Oral acyclovir",
      "IV caspofungin"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient is likely presenting with oral candidiasis (thrush). Topical nystatin or oral fluconazole are first-line treatments for oral candidiasis. Given the patient's HIV status, it is important to consider potential interactions with antiretroviral therapy when selecting an antifungal agent.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Focus on the presentation suggestive of oral candidiasis and the importance of selecting an appropriate antifungal that considers potential drug interactions in an HIV-positive patient."
  },
  {
    question: "A 60-year-old man with leukemia develops a fever and chills while neutropenic. Blood cultures grow Candida albicans. He is hemodynamically stable and has no signs of organ dysfunction. What is the most appropriate initial antifungal therapy?",
    options: [
      "Oral fluconazole",
      "IV caspofungin",
      "Oral itraconazole",
      "IV amphotericin B deoxycholate",
      "Topical clotrimazole"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In a non-critically ill patient with candidemia and no signs of organ dysfunction, oral fluconazole is an appropriate initial therapy, provided there is no known resistance. The patient's stable hemodynamic status and lack of organ dysfunction allow for oral therapy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the appropriate management of a stable patient with candidemia and no signs of organ dysfunction. Which antifungal agent is effective and can be administered orally in this scenario?"
