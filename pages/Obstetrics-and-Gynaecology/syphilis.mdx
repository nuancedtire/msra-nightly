# Understanding Syphilis: Diagnosis, Stages, and Management

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium *Treponema pallidum*. This bacterium is a spirochete that requires a human host to survive. Transmission typically occurs through sexual contact involving mucosal breaks or direct contact with infected skin lesions or needles. Syphilis can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, leading to congenital syphilis.

Patients with congenital syphilis may exhibit early signs like hepatosplenomegaly, mucous membrane ulceration, and rhinitis.

## Diagnosis and Stages

The progression of syphilis is characterized by distinct stages, each with unique clinical features:

### Primary Stage

- Occurs 1-3 weeks post-infection.
- Features a chancre, which is a painless ulcer at the infection site, often teeming with bacteria, facilitating its spread through direct contact. In women, chancres are frequently located on the cervix.
- Accompanied by localized, non-tender lymphadenopathy.
- Without treatment, the infection may advance to the secondary stage within 6-10 weeks.

### Secondary Stage

- Manifests with systemic symptoms like fever, malaise, and generalized lymphadenopathy.
- A non-itchy maculopapular rash, occasionally pustular, appears on the trunk and extremities, including the palms and soles, but spares the face.
- Painless, warty growths called condylomata may develop on the genitalia.

### Tertiary Syphilis

- Characterized by granulomatous lesions called gummas affecting bones, skin, heart, liver, and the central nervous system (CNS).
- Notable for the Argyll-Robertson pupil.
- Features tabes dorsalis, a slow degeneration of the spinal cord's dorsal columns.
- Can lead to general paralysis of the insane, where cortical damage gradually results in paralysis and dementia.

### Latent Syphilis

- Most of the disease resolves, but a residual population of spirochetes persists in tissue capillaries.
- The immune response, specifically a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction, to these remaining bacteria can trigger the onset of tertiary syphilis.

## Investigations

To confirm a syphilis diagnosis, serum analysis can detect antibodies against *T. pallidum*. Still, a positive result cannot differentiate between an active or previously treated infection as antibodies persist for life. Dark-field microscopy of a lesion swab is another diagnostic option. If the initial test is negative, it's recommended to take three samples on different days to confirm the result.

## Management

### Prescribing

- Intramuscular (IM) single dose of 1.8g benzylpenicillin is the first-line treatment.
- For those allergic to benzylpenicillin, doxycycline is an alternative.
- A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction may occur following the initial treatment due to bacterial endotoxin release, resulting in fever, rash, and tachycardia. Prednisolone may be administered concurrently to mitigate this reaction.

### Non-prescribing

- Sexual partners of individuals with confirmed syphilis should undergo screening and receive treatment, particularly if there are concerns about follow-up adherence.
