# Mammary Paget's Disease: An Overview

Mammary Paget's disease is a rare form of skin cancer that affects the nipple and the surrounding areolar skin. This condition is often associated with more serious breast cancers and typically presents in women over 50 years of age.

## Understanding Mammary Paget's Disease

Mammary Paget's disease, also known as Paget's disease of the breast or nipple, is characterized as an intraepithelial adenocarcinoma. It is frequently associated with underlying breast cancer conditions, such as invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ. Although the disease predominantly affects one breast (unilateral), there are rare instances where it can be bilateral.

## Diagnostic Criteria

### Clinical Presentation

Patients with Mammary Paget's disease may exhibit the following symptoms:

- Persistent itching
- An eczematous lesion on the nipple, which may spread to the areolar skin
- Signs of inflammation, including:
  - **Redness**
  - **Swelling**
  - **Scale formation**
- Nipple abnormalities, such as:
  - Discharge that could be oozing or bloody
  - Ulceration
  - Inversion
- A palpable mass in the breast

### Confirmatory Testing

A definitive diagnosis of Mammary Paget's disease requires:

- A thorough history and physical examination
- A skin biopsy to identify **Paget cells** and assess for signs of underlying breast carcinoma

<Callout>
**Note:** A negative skin biopsy does not eliminate the possibility of breast cancer, as the cancer may be located deeper in the breast tissue.
</Callout>

Additional imaging studies are necessary to investigate the potential for underlying breast malignancy, including:

- Mammography
- Breast MRI

## Management Strategies

### Medical Intervention

There is no specific pharmacological treatment for Mammary Paget's disease itself. However, addressing any underlying breast cancer may involve medical therapies.

### Surgical Approach

The primary management of Mammary Paget's disease involves surgical intervention:

- **First-line treatment:** Mastectomy, with or without axillary lymph node dissection, is recommended regardless of clinical evidence of underlying breast malignancy.
- **Alternative options:**
  - Breast-conserving surgery, such as wide local excision with lymph node biopsy, optionally followed by radiotherapy.
  - Conservative treatments with high recurrence rates, which may include:
    - Partial nipple excision
    - Wedge excision
    - Cone excision
    - Radiotherapy alone

**Warning:** The choice of treatment should be individualized based on the extent of the disease and patient preferences.

  {
    question: "A 53-year-old woman presents with a six-month history of persistent itching and a scaly lesion on her left nipple. On examination, there is erythema and mild inversion of the nipple. She denies any discharge or palpable mass in the breast. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in her evaluation?",
    options: [
      "Prescribe topical steroids and follow-up in six weeks",
      "Immediate full mastectomy without further evaluation",
      "Order a bilateral mammogram and skin biopsy of the lesion",
      "Start empirical antibiotics and assess response",
      "Request a breast MRI without mammography"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the clinical presentation suggestive of Mammary Paget's disease, the patient should undergo a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of Paget cells and a bilateral mammogram to evaluate for underlying breast malignancy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While this option may be appropriate for common skin conditions, the patient's presentation is suggestive of Mammary Paget's disease. What diagnostic tests would be most helpful to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for underlying malignancy?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 60-year-old woman is diagnosed with Mammary Paget's disease following a confirmatory skin biopsy. Imaging studies also reveal an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ. Which of the following treatment options is considered first-line for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Topical chemotherapy cream applied to the nipple",
      "Mastectomy with or without axillary lymph node dissection",
      "Partial nipple excision followed by radiotherapy",
      "Oral hormonal therapy targeting estrogen receptors",
      "Wait-and-watch approach with regular follow-up"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Mastectomy, with or without axillary lymph node dissection, is the recommended first-line treatment for Mammary Paget's disease, regardless of clinical evidence of underlying breast malignancy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Although local treatments can be considered, there is a first-line surgical treatment for Mammary Paget's disease, especially when associated with an underlying carcinoma. What is the most definitive surgical approach recommended?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 48-year-old woman with Mammary Paget's disease undergoes a skin biopsy that reveals Paget cells but no palpable mass in the breast. Despite the biopsy results, she insists on a breast-conserving approach. What is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Perform mastectomy to ensure complete removal of potential malignancy",
      "Offer breast-conserving surgery with lymph node biopsy and radiotherapy",
      "Advise against any surgical intervention due to her preference",
      "Initiate chemotherapy to treat the Paget cells without surgery",
      "Prescribe high-dose corticosteroids to manage the skin lesion"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In patients who prefer a breast-conserving approach, options such as wide local excision with lymph node biopsy followed by radiotherapy can be considered, depending on the extent of the disease and patient preferences.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While respecting patient preferences is important, there are breast-conserving options that can be considered which may still address the malignancy. What alternative to mastectomy might be appropriate?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a diagnosis of Mammary Paget's disease and no palpable breast mass is found to have two negative mammograms. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    options: [
      "Discharge with reassurance and no further action",
      "Repeat skin biopsy of the nipple-areolar complex",
      "Order a breast MRI to evaluate for occult malignancy",
      "Prescribe oral antifungal treatment and reassess in two weeks",
      "Initiate palliative care due to the poor prognosis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A negative mammogram does not rule out the possibility of an underlying breast malignancy, especially in the context of Mammary Paget's disease. A breast MRI can be useful in detecting occult malignancies not visible on mammography.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Although mammograms are useful, they are not infallible. Given the diagnosis of Mammary Paget's disease, there's a need for further evaluation for occult malignancy. What imaging study might reveal malignancies not detected by mammograms?"
