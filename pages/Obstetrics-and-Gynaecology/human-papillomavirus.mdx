# Human Papillomavirus (HPV): Overview, Risks, and Management

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) encompasses over 100 subtypes, influencing various body areas. These subtypes fall into categories such as mucosal or anogenital HPV, non-genital (cutaneous) HPV, and those associated with Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). Belonging to the Papilloviridae family, HPV is a non-enveloped virus with circular, double-stranded DNA, exploiting disruptions in skin or mucosa to infect basal stem cells.

## Understanding HPV Transmission and Risk Factors

HPV transmission is primarily through skin-to-skin contact, with sexual activity being a significant risk factor. However, HPV can also spread through non-sexual means. Here's a breakdown of the risk factors:

- Sexual activity (vaginal, anal, and/or oral) with multiple partners, although it can be contracted from the first sexual encounter.
- Sharing sex toys.

**Note:** Some HPV subtypes are associated with low-risk lesions, while others are linked to high-risk lesions that can progress to cancer.

## Classification of HPV Subtypes

HPV is classified based on its potential to cause lesions and cancer:

- **Low Risk:**
  - Subtypes 6 and 11: Typically present with low-grade precancerous lesions.
- **High Risk:**
  - Subtypes 16 and 18: Known for causing high-grade intraepithelial lesions, potentially progressing to malignancies.

Cancer development from HPV usually requires additional triggers such as smoking, immunosuppression, folate deficiency, UV light exposure, and pregnancy.

## Diagnosis of HPV Infections

A thorough physical examination is crucial in diagnosing HPV. It includes the inspection of:

- **Cutaneous warts:** Hands and feet, including between digits.
- **Anogenital warts:** Anogenital area, potentially requiring a speculum exam of the anus or vaginal wall.
- **Cervical dysplasia:** Cervix, via a speculum exam.

Cervical screening, incorporating HPV testing, is routinely offered to women aged 25-64. Abnormalities in cervical cells detected during Pap smears necessitate further evaluation by colposcopy.

## Investigations and Screening

Cervical screening tests help identify pre-cancerous and cancerous changes:

- These tests are crucial for women showing no symptoms, as early detection through screening can lead to effective treatment and cancer prevention.

## Management of HPV

### Prescribing Management

For immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV, management includes:

- Prescribing antiretroviral medication.
- Emphasizing the importance of medication adherence.

### Non-Prescribing Management

HPV vaccination is provided to both boys and girls in the UK aged 12 to 13, targeting subtypes 6, 11, 16, and 18.

**Patient Education:**
- Safe sex practices, such as condom use.
- Importance of Pap smear screening.
- Avoiding multiple sexual partners.

Patients with dysplastic changes detected via Pap smears should receive a colposcopy referral. Treatment for high-grade dysplasia includes cryotherapy, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), or cold knife cone excision.

Anogenital HPV-associated carcinomas may require surgical excision, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy.

**Warning:** HPV can be asymptomatic, making regular screening vital for early detection and management.

    question: "A 31-year-old woman presents with a history of multiple sexual partners and has noticed several small, painless growths in the anogenital region. Physical examination confirms the presence of anogenital warts. Which of the following HPV subtypes is most likely responsible for these lesions?",
    options: [
      "Subtypes 6 and 11",
      "Subtypes 16 and 18",
      "Subtypes 31 and 33",
      "Subtypes 45 and 51",
      "Subtypes 52 and 58"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Subtypes 6 and 11 of human papillomavirus (HPV) are typically associated with low-risk lesions, such as anogenital warts, which are also known as condyloma acuminata.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the HPV subtypes that are commonly associated with low-grade lesions such as anogenital warts rather than high-grade intraepithelial lesions or malignancies."
  },
  {
    question: "A 26-year-old woman with a history of smoking and a new diagnosis of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) on Pap smear is referred for colposcopy. Which risk factor, in addition to the HPV infection, is likely to have contributed to the development of her high-grade CIN?",
    options: [
      "Use of oral contraceptives",
      "History of smoking",
      "High intake of folate",
      "Use of sunscreen when exposed to UV light",
      "Prior full-term pregnancy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Smoking is a cofactor that can contribute to the progression of HPV infection to high-grade intraepithelial lesions and potentially to cervical cancer.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the additional triggers that can contribute to the development of high-grade intraepithelial lesions or malignancies in the presence of HPV infection."

    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the HPV-related conditions that can occur in males and which of these the HPV vaccine is known to prevent."

    question: "During a routine cervical screening of a 35-year-old woman, a Pap smear reveals atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). HPV testing is subsequently performed and returns positive for a high-risk HPV subtype. Given the findings, what is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Repeat Pap smear and HPV testing in 3 years",
      "Immediate colposcopy",
      "Prescription of antiretroviral medication",
