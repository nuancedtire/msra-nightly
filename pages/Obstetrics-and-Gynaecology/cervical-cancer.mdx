# Cervical Cancer: Overview, Diagnosis, and Management

Cervical cancer, while not the most prevalent cancer among women in the UK, is significant due to its potential for early detection and treatment. The structured screening program plays a crucial role in identifying pre-cancerous and cancerous conditions, leading to effective intervention.

## Incidence and Early Detection

Cervical cancer is the 14th most common cancer in women in the UK, with a notable feature being its high early-stage detection rate. Approximately 75% of cases are diagnosed at stage I or II.

### Demographics and Risk Factors

- Sharp increase in incidence from the age of 20-24 years, peaking at 30-34 years.
- Decline in incidence in older age groups.
- Risk factors:
  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially serotypes 16, 18, and 33.
  - Immunocompromised state (e.g., HIV infection).
  - Smoking.
  - Early first sexual intercourse.
  - Multiple sexual partners.
  - Lack of condom use.
- HPV vaccination for 12-13-year-old girls and boys in England targets HPV types 16, 18, 6, and 11.

*Note: The cervical screening program aims to identify and treat pre-malignant lesions to prevent cancer development.*

## Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis

Routine screening is key in detecting cervical cancer. Clinical symptoms are often nonspecific and can include:

- Blood-stained vaginal discharge.
- Abnormal vaginal bleeding: postcoital (PCB), intermenstrual (IMB), or postmenopausal (PMB).
- Inflamed cervix or visible mass upon pelvic examination.

### Investigations

- **Colposcopy**: Urgent referral if cervical cancer is suspected.
  - Diagnostic criteria include white staining with acetic acid and abnormal vascularity.
- **Biopsy**: To obtain histological diagnosis and identify cancer subtype.
  - Pre-invasive disease termed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
  - Common invasive types: squamous cell carcinoma (80%) and adenocarcinoma.

## Screening Programme

- Offered to individuals with a cervix aged 25 to 64 in England.
- Frequency:
  - Ages 25-49: Every 3 years.
  - Ages 50-64: Every 5 years.
- Method: Cervical smear test for direct collection of cervical epithelial cells.
- High-risk HPV testing as the primary screening tool.
  - HPV-negative: Return to routine screening.
  - HPV-positive: Perform cytology to examine cells microscopically.

### Follow-Up Protocol

- Negative cytology with positive HPV: Repeat HPV test at 12 months.
  - If negative after 12 months, return to routine screening.
  - If positive, repeat the test in another 12 months before referral to colposcopy.

## Management Strategies

### Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)

- Surveillance and/or excision to prevent invasive cancer.
- Follow-up at 6 months post-treatment with colposcopy.
- HPV screening and cytology at follow-up to determine return to routine screening or need for further treatment.

### Cervical Cancer

Management depends on the FIGO stage:

- **Stage IA1**: Cone biopsy or large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).
- **Stages IA2-IIA**:
  - Tumors ≤ 4 cm: Radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy.
  - Tumors > 4 cm: Chemoradiotherapy.
  - Fertility-sparing option: Radical trachelectomy.
- **Stage IIB-IVA**: Chemoradiotherapy.
- **Stage IVB**: Combination chemotherapy.

**Warning:** Management strategies should be personalized based on individual patient factors and staging.

  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman presents with postcoital bleeding and a history of multiple sexual partners. She is referred for a colposcopy which reveals an inflamed cervix with white staining with acetic acid. A biopsy is performed. Which of the following is the most likely histological diagnosis if an invasive disease is confirmed?",
    options: [
      "Adenocarcinoma",
      "Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma",
      "Endometrial carcinoma",
      "Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 80% of invasive cervical cancers and is likely to be the diagnosis in this patient with the given clinical presentation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the most common histological subtypes of cervical cancer and the demographics typically affected. Which subtype is more prevalent in a patient of this age with risk factors for cervical cancer?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old woman has been diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II following an abnormal cervical screening test. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    options: [
      "Immediate referral for radical hysterectomy",
      "Surveillance with repeat colposcopy in 6 months",
      "Chemoradiotherapy",
      "Large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ)",
      "HPV vaccination and routine follow-up"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For CIN II, the management often involves excisional procedures such as LLETZ to prevent the progression to invasive cancer, followed by surveillance.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the stage of the disease and the standard treatment options for pre-invasive cervical lesions. Which treatment would be appropriate for this stage and aims to prevent progression?"
  },
  {

    correctFeedback: "Correct! For stage IA2 cervical cancer, the recommended treatment is a radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy. Fertility-preserving options may be considered in select cases.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the FIGO stage of the patient's cervical cancer and the corresponding standard treatment guidelines. Which treatment is indicated for early-stage cervical cancer that allows for complete removal of the disease?"
