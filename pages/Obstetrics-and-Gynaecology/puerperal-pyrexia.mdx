# Understanding Puerperal Pyrexia

Puerperal pyrexia, or postpartum fever, is a medical condition characterized by a woman experiencing a fever of `>= 38.0 degrees Celsius` within the first six weeks post-delivery.

## Common Sources and Risk Factors

The fever may originate from several areas, including:

- Pelvic organs
- Urinary tract
- Respiratory tract
- Breasts
- Surgical wounds, if present
- Legs

### Risk Factors

Certain factors can increase the likelihood of puerperal pyrexia:

- Lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) – associated with an increased risk of postpartum sepsis, wound issues, urinary tract infections, and fever
- Prolonged rupture of membranes
- Anaemia
- Genital tract trauma
- Instrumentation during labor
- Ascending infection due to bacterial colonization of the vagina, leading to conditions like endometritis and parametritis

## Clinical Evaluation

### History Taking

A thorough history should include:

- Timing of membrane rupture
- Duration of labor
- Instrumentation utilized
- Suture application
- Completeness of the placenta after delivery
- Any bleeding episodes during or post-delivery

### Physical Examination

Examination involves:

- Vital signs: temperature, blood pressure
- Palpation of the uterus for size and tenderness
- Evaluation of perineal wounds and lochia
- Breast examination
- Chest inspection for infection signs
- Abdominal examination
- Calf examination for swelling

## Complications

Puerperal pyrexia can lead to both local and systemic complications:

### Local Complications

- Abscess formation in the pelvic area or breast
- Adhesions, peritonitis, hemorrhage, infertility from genital infections
- Pyelonephritis, renal scarring from urinary tract infections

### Systemic Complications

- Septicaemia, septic shock
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of puerperal pyrexia is established when a postpartum woman registers a temperature of `>= 38.0 degrees Celsius` within six weeks following delivery.

## Investigations

The clinical picture should guide the choice of investigations, which may include:

- High vaginal swab
- Urine cultures and microscopy
- Wound swabs, endocervical swabs, throat swabs as needed
- Full Blood Count (FBC)
- Blood cultures
- Ultrasound scan for retained conception products
- Chest x-ray and sputum culture when indicated

## Management

### Prescribing Measures

- **Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics:** Initiate intravenous antibiotics within `1 hour` of severe sepsis suspicion. Do not delay until results are available. Recommended options include piperacillin/tazobactam or a carbapenem and clindamycin (or vancomycin if MRSA is a concern). Breastfeeding considerations are essential.
- **Analgesia:** Required in some cases. Avoid NSAIDs as they can interfere with the body's ability to combat GAS infection.
- **IVIg:** For severe invasive streptococcal or staphylococcal infections unresponsive to initial treatment.
- **Heparin:** Consider for prolonged fever cases.

### Non-Prescribing Measures

- **General Care:** Rest, sufficient fluid intake, use of ice packs.
- **Surgical Intervention:** May be necessary in case of suspected abscess.
- **Prevention Strategies:**
  - Maintain hygiene during and post-labor.
  - Prophylactic antibiotics for LSCS or prolonged labor.
  - Minimize catheterization.
  - Prompt cleaning and suturing of perineal wounds.
  - Monitor blood loss and placenta completeness.
  - Encourage early mobilization.
  - Support successful breastfeeding to lower mastitis risk.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman presents with a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius, abdominal pain, and foul-smelling lochia on the third postpartum day after a vaginal delivery with prolonged rupture of membranes. Her pulse is 110 bpm, and blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg. On examination, her uterus is tender on palpation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Urinary tract infection",
      "Wound infection",
      "Postpartum endometritis",
      "Mastitis",
      "Thrombophlebitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The clinical presentation of fever, abdominal pain, tender uterus, and foul-smelling lochia, especially after prolonged rupture of membranes, is characteristic of postpartum endometritis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the common sources of puerperal pyrexia in relation to the time of onset, clinical features, and risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes."
  },
  {
    question: "A 25-year-old primigravida underwent an emergency lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) due to fetal distress. On the fourth day post-operation, she develops a fever of 38.2 degrees Celsius, tachycardia, and pain at the incision site. On examination, the wound is erythematous and edematous with serous discharge. Which of the following management steps is most appropriate initially?",
    options: [
      "Perform an ultrasound scan to rule out retained conception products",
      "Prescribe oral antibiotics and advise rest and regular wound cleaning",
      "Take a swab from the wound for culture and initiate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics",
      "Administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) immediately",
      "Start heparin therapy to prevent thromboembolic complications"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient shows signs of a surgical site infection. A swab should be taken for culture to guide definitive antibiotic therapy, but broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be initiated immediately without waiting for results.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the most immediate and crucial actions to take when managing a postoperative wound infection."
  },
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old woman is in the early postpartum period after a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. She develops a fever of 38.3 degrees Celsius, chills, and right-sided flank pain. Urinalysis reveals pyuria and bacteriuria. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Start empirical intravenous antibiotics and obtain urine culture",

      "Refer for ultrasound-guided drainage of a suspected abscess",
      "Prescribe NSAIDs for analgesia and anti-inflammatory effect",
      "Administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) for suspected sepsis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The clinical presentation suggests a urinary tract infection. Empirical intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately, and a urine culture should be obtained to identify the causative organism.",
    incorrectFeedback: "What is the most likely source of infection based on the patient's symptoms, and how should it be managed?"
  },
  {
