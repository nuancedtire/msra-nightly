# HELLP Syndrome in Pregnancy

## Introduction

HELLP syndrome is a severe form of pre-eclampsia that can occur during the second half of pregnancy or immediately post-partum. It is characterized by the following clinical features:

- Hemolysis (H)
- Elevated Liver enzymes (EL)
- Low Platelet count (LP)

Careful consideration of this condition is warranted in any pregnant or recently post-partum patient presenting with specific symptoms.

## Recognizing HELLP Syndrome

When encountering a pregnant patient in the latter stage of their pregnancy or who is post-partum, exhibiting symptoms such as right-upper quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric pain, HELLP syndrome should be a primary differential diagnosis.

### Clinical Presentation

Patients with HELLP syndrome may exhibit a range of symptoms, including:

- Hypertension and proteinuria
- RUQ or epigastric pain
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting
- General malaise

### Laboratory Findings

Diagnostic markers for HELLP syndrome include:

- Elevated liver function transaminases (ALT, AST – typically `>70 IU/L`)
- Platelet count `<100 x 10⁹/L`
- Total serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) `>600 IU/L`

Some patients might present with unexplained thrombocytopenia without systemic symptoms.

### Indicators of Haemolysis

Signs of haemolysis can include:

- Elevated bilirubin levels
- Increased liver AST
- High LDH
- Worsening anaemia
- Presence of haematuria
- Schistocytes in blood film

**Note:** Always consider HELLP syndrome in the appropriate clinical context to prevent misdiagnosis and ensure timely management.
</Callout>

## Diagnostic Criteria

### Risk Factors

Patients may be at higher risk for developing HELLP syndrome due to:

- Maternal age `>35 years`
- Multiple gestations
- History of pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancies
- Pre-existing chronic hypertension
- Diabetes mellitus
- Obesity

### Symptoms and Signs

The following signs and symptoms are diagnostic considerations for HELLP syndrome:

- RUQ/epigastric tenderness or pain
- Malaise, nausea
- Headache or visual disturbances
- Brisk tendon reflexes
- Oedema
- Jaundice

## Investigations

To confirm the diagnosis, the following investigations may be conducted:

- **Blood Tests:**
  - Full blood count
  - Liver function tests
  - Blood smear test
  - Total serum LDH
  - Coagulation profile
- **Urinalysis:**
  - Urine protein-creatinine ratio
- **Imaging:**
  - Foetal ultrasound

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Interventions

For suspected HELLP syndrome:

- **Seizure Prophylaxis:**
  - Magnesium sulfate: 4-6g as a loading dose, followed by 1-2g/hour for a minimum of 24 hours (maximum 40g/day)
- **Intravenous Dexamethasone:**
  - Administered alongside seizure prophylaxis

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** If the patient's blood pressure exceeds 160/105mmHg, initiate antihypertensive therapy immediately with either labetalol (primary) or nicardipine (secondary).
</Callout>

### Acute Management

In the event of an acute presentation:

- **Delivery:**
  - Considered the first-line response, alongside intravenous dexamethasone
- **Adjunctive Measures:**
  - Continue seizure prophylaxis
  - Provide antihypertensive therapy if BP `≥160/105mmHg`
  - Administer cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma if fibrinogen `<100mg/dL`
  - Offer platelet transfusion for platelet counts `<25 x 10⁹/L` (add anti-D immunoglobulin if indicated)

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

- **Weight Management Education:**
  - For obese patients, provide guidance on weight loss, preferably before pregnancy
- **Hypertension Management:**
  - Educate patients with chronic hypertension on the importance of adhering to prescribed medication

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, at 34 weeks gestation presents with a 24-hour history of right upper quadrant pain, malaise, and a headache. Her blood pressure is 160/110 mmHg, and urinalysis shows 2+ proteinuria. Laboratory tests reveal platelet count of 85 x 10⁹/L, AST 120 IU/L, ALT 100 IU/L, and LDH 700 IU/L. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Immediate cesarean delivery",
      "Administer magnesium sulfate and monitor the patient",
      "Administer labetalol to control blood pressure and prepare for delivery",
      "Administer intravenous dexamethasone and prepare for delivery",
      "Outpatient follow-up in one week with repeat labs"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient has signs consistent with HELLP syndrome, which includes hypertension, proteinuria, and laboratory findings indicative of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. The immediate goal is to control blood pressure with labetalol and prepare for delivery, the definitive treatment for HELLP syndrome.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While seizure prophylaxis and antihypertensive management are important, consider the urgency of the situation and the definitive treatment for HELLP syndrome."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with confirmed HELLP syndrome is being treated in the hospital. Which of the following blood products is most appropriate to administer if the patient's fibrinogen levels drop below 100 mg/dL?",
    options: [
      "Platelet transfusion alone",
      "Cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma",
      "Packed red blood cells",
      "Anti-D immunoglobulin alone",
      "Cryoprecipitate and anti-D immunoglobulin concomitantly"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma is indicated for patients with HELLP syndrome when fibrinogen levels drop below 100 mg/dL to manage the coagulopathy associated with the condition.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the component of blood that specifically targets low fibrinogen levels in the setting of coagulopathy."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following risk factors is not traditionally associated with an increased risk of developing HELLP syndrome?",
    options: [
      "Maternal age >35 years",
      "Multiple gestations",
      "History of pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancies",
      "Pre-existing chronic hypertension",
      "Nulliparity"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Nulliparity is not listed as a traditional risk factor for HELLP syndrome. Risk factors include advanced maternal age, multiple gestations, a history of pre-eclampsia, chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the risk factors for HELLP syndrome and determine which one is not typically associated with an increased risk."
  },
  {
