# Understanding Endometriosis

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus. This can affect women of all ages and commonly involves areas such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and pelvic peritoneum.

## Diagnosis of Endometriosis

### Clinical Presentation

Patients may present with a range of symptoms including:

- Dysmenorrhea (painful periods)
- Chronic or cyclic pelvic pain
- Dyspareunia (painful intercourse)
- Sub-fertility
- Nodularity in the uterosacral ligaments
- A uterus that is fixed and retroverted
- Depression

### Risk Factors

Several factors may increase the risk of developing endometriosis:

- Family history of the condition
- Nulliparity (having never given birth)
- A lower body mass index (BMI)
- Smoking habits
- History of caesarean section
- Mullerian anomalies

### Diagnostic Procedures

Endometriosis is confirmed through:

- Direct visualization and histological examination during a laparoscopic procedure.

#### Investigations

Initial and subsequent investigations include:

- **First-order**: Transvaginal ultrasound
- **Supplementary**:
  - Rectal endoscopic ultrasound
  - 3D ultrasonography
  - MRI of the pelvis
  - Hysterosalpingography
  - Diagnostic laparoscopy

## Management Strategies

### Infertility and Endometriosis

While the precise relationship between endometriosis and infertility is unclear, more severe disease may lead to adhesions that inhibit natural conception.

#### Fertility Treatments

For patients seeking to conceive:

- **First-line**: Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (e.g., clomifene)
- **Second-line**: In vitro fertilisation (IVF)

### Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis

This refers to endometriosis beyond superficial tissues, potentially affecting the pelvic wall, bowel, uterus, bladder, or parametrium.

#### Surgical Intervention

- **Therapeutic laparoscopy** is recommended for patients with deep disease or endometriomas, particularly if symptomatic.
- Surgery should be considered for those symptomatic without deep disease or endometriomas.
- For conception planning, therapeutic laparoscopy may be an adjunct therapy.

#### Hormonal and Non-Hormonal Therapies

For non-conceiving patients with endometriomas or suspected deep disease:

- **First-line**: Surgery, with post-surgical hormone therapy as an adjunct.

For symptomatic patients without endometriomas or suspected deep disease:

- **First-line**: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)
- **Second-line**: Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or GnRH antagonist
- **Third-line**: Androgen therapy
- **Fourth-line**: Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and excision of visible peritoneal disease, followed by adjunct hormone-replacement therapy.

**Note:** Treatment options should be personalized based on the patient's symptoms, disease severity, and reproductive plans.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman with a BMI of 19 presents with a history of painful periods and infertility. She reports experiencing significant dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. On examination, her uterus is fixed and retroverted. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-order investigation to evaluate for endometriosis in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Transvaginal ultrasound",
      "Rectal endoscopic ultrasound",
      "3D ultrasonography",
      "MRI of the pelvis",
      "Diagnostic laparoscopy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Transvaginal ultrasound is the appropriate first-order investigation for evaluating a patient suspected of having endometriosis, particularly when presenting with symptoms like dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the most suitable first-order investigation for a patient presenting with symptoms indicative of endometriosis, such as painful periods and infertility."
  },
  {
    question: "A 27-year-old woman with deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the bowel and bladder desires future fertility. She is symptomatic with chronic pelvic pain and dyschezia. She has not conceived after 12 months of trying. Which management strategy is most appropriate for her condition?",
    options: [
      "Immediate in vitro fertilization (IVF)",
      "Therapeutic laparoscopy followed by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation",
      "Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy",
      "Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy",
      "Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) as sole treatment"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Therapeutic laparoscopy is recommended for patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis who are symptomatic, and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation may be considered as a fertility treatment after surgical intervention.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the appropriate management for a symptomatic patient with deep infiltrating endometriosis who wishes to preserve fertility."
  },
  {
    question: "A 24-year-old woman with endometriosis is not planning to conceive and complains of ongoing pelvic pain despite NSAID therapy. You contemplate advancing her treatment to the next line of management. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
    options: [
      "Initiate combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)",
      "Schedule for diagnostic laparoscopy",
      "Prescribe a GnRH antagonist",
      "Recommend hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy",
      "Start androgen therapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For a non-conceiving patient with endometriosis and ongoing symptoms despite NSAID therapy, the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is an appropriate first-line hormonal treatment option.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the step-wise management of endometriosis in patients who are not seeking conception and still have symptoms after NSAID therapy."
  },
  {
    question: "A 30-year-old nulliparous woman with a family history of endometriosis presents with chronic pelvic pain and infertility. If diagnostic laparoscopy confirms endometriosis without deep infiltrating disease, which of the following is the most appropriate management for her infertility?",

      "Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with clomifene",
      "Immediate initiation of in vitro fertilization (IVF)",
