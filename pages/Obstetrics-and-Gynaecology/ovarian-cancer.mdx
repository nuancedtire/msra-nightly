# Ovarian Cancer: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

Ovarian cancer, a significant gynecologic malignancy, ranks as the second most common type and has a notably high mortality rate. While the average age of diagnosis in the United States is 63, individuals with hereditary ovarian cancer syndromes, like those with BRCA gene mutations or Lynch syndrome, tend to be diagnosed at younger ages. The general population's lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is around 1.3%.

## Types of Ovarian Cancer

Ovarian cancer primarily stems from different cell types, with epithelial cells accounting for 95% of cases. Henceforth, we will focus on epithelial ovarian carcinoma when discussing ovarian cancer. The types include:

- **Epithelial Cells:**
  - Serous carcinoma:
    - High grade (`70%`)
    - Low grade (`<5%`)
  - Endometroid carcinoma (`10%`)
  - Clear cell carcinoma (`10%`)
  - Mucinous carcinoma (`3%`)
- **Germ Cell Tumours:**
  - Malignant teratoma
  - Dysgerminoma
  - Choriocarcinoma
  - Endodermal sinus tumour (Yolk sac tumour)
  - Embryonal carcinoma
- **Sex Cord-Stromal Tumours:**
  - Granulosa cell tumours

Secondary metastases, which represent a smaller portion of ovarian malignancies, often affect both ovaries and commonly originate from the breast, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum.

## Risk and Protective Factors

The balance of risk and protective factors is vital in understanding ovarian cancer. Notable risk factors include increasing age, early menarche, late menopause, infertility, nulliparity, endometriosis, and hereditary cancer syndromes. Conversely, factors such as previous pregnancies, breastfeeding history, oral contraceptive use, tubal ligation, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and hysterectomy can have protective effects.

## Clinical Presentation

Ovarian cancer typically presents subacutely, with symptoms like pelvic or abdominal pain, bloating, early satiety, abdominal distension, vaginal discharge, menstrual irregularities, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Acute presentations, indicating an advanced stage, may include acute abdomen, dyspnea from pleural effusion, and bowel obstruction.

## Differential Diagnosis

An adnexal mass can have various differential diagnoses divided into gynecological and non-gynecological causes, ranging from benign conditions like functional cysts to malignant ones such as metastatic endometrial carcinoma.

- Tubal (Benign):
  - Ectopic pregnancy
  - Hydrosalpinx
- Tubal (Malignant):
  - Epithelial carcinoma
  - Serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasia

**Non-gynaecological Causes:**

- Benign:
  - Constipation
  - Appendiceal abscess
  - Diverticular abscess
  - Pelvic abscess
  - Pelvic kidney
- Malignant:
  - Appendiceal neoplasm
  - Bowel neoplasm
  - Metastasis (e.g. Breast, colon, lymphoma)

## Spread of Ovarian Cancer

Ovarian cancer spreads through various modes:

- Trans-coelomic
- Direct invasion
- Lymphatic
- Hematogenous

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of ovarian cancer is confirmed histopathologically after surgical removal of an ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneal biopsies. The standard staging procedure is a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (THBSO) and lymph node dissection. The 2017 FIGO/TNM classification system is used for surgical staging:

- Stage 1: Growth limited to the ovaries
- Stage 2: Growth with pelvic extension
- Stage 3: Localized intra-abdominal metastases
- Stage 4: Distant metastases (above the diaphragm)

Most ovarian cancers are high-grade serous carcinomas, often diagnosed at stage III or IV, contributing to a generally poor prognosis.

## Investigations

Given the invasive nature of the definitive diagnosis, preoperative evaluations are crucial. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) aids in gauging malignancy based on menopausal status, ultrasound features, and serum CA-125 levels. Investigations include routine preoperative workup, tumor markers like CA-125, and various imaging studies such as ultrasound, MRI, and CT scans.

## Management

### Prescribing Management

Chemotherapy is a mainstay in the treatment of ovarian cancer, especially for patients with stage IC or II disease, those who can undergo primary surgical cytoreduction, and those with clear cell histology or high tumor grade. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered when optimal cytoreduction is unlikely or in patients with medical comorbidities.

### Non-Prescribing Management

For low-stage cancers, THBSO is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Advanced cases may require debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Factors influencing prognosis include age, residual disease volume, performance status, and histology. Most patients with advanced-stage disease will eventually relapse and need further treatment.

**Tip:** Genetic counseling and testing are recommended for all patients diagnosed with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, regardless of family history, due to potential treatment implications.

Despite the lack of effective screening strategies for average-risk women, genetic counseling and testing remain crucial for those diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
