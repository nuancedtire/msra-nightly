# Oral Contraceptive Pills: Usage and Guidelines

Oral contraception serves the dual purpose of preventing pregnancy and managing various medical conditions. There are two main categories of oral contraceptive pills: the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and the progesterone-only pill (POP).

## Indications for Oral Contraceptive Pills

Oral contraceptive pills are recommended for various reasons, including:

- **Contraception**
- Management of menstrual-related disorders:
  - Dysmenorrhea
  - Menorrhagia
  - Irregular bleeding
  - Menstrual-related migraines
- Treatment for anemia due to heavy menstrual bleeding
- Acne control
- Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
- Alleviation of menopausal symptoms

## Types of Oral Contraceptive Pills

### Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (COCP)

- Contains both estrogen and progesterone
- Mechanisms of action:
  - Inhibits ovulation
  - Thickens cervical mucus to prevent sperm entry
- Timing of initiation:
  - Begin within the first five days of the menstrual cycle for immediate contraception
  - Use condoms for the first 7 days if initiated at any other time
- Variants of COCP:
  - **Monophasic 21-Day Pill:**
    - Same hormone dosage in all pills
    - 21 days on, 7 days off, allowing for a withdrawal bleed
    - Up to three packs can be taken consecutively without breaks
    - Examples: Microgynon, Marvelon, Yasmin
  - **Phasic 21-Day Pill:**
    - Varying hormone dosages requiring correct sequence intake
    - 21 days on, 7 days off, with a withdrawal bleed
    - Example: Logynon
  - **Every Day Pill:**
    - Daily intake with 21 active pills and 7 placebo pills
    - Correct sequence intake necessary
- Side effects:
  - Irregular bleeding
  - Nausea
  - Breast tenderness
  - Headaches (often subside after initial months)
- Associated risks:
  - Venous thromboembolism (VTE) – a small risk, avoid in high-risk groups
  - Myocardial infarction and stroke – minimal risk
  - Breast cancer – minimal risk
- UK Medical Eligibility Criteria (UKMEC):
  - **UKMEC 1:** No restriction for use
  - **UKMEC 2:** Benefits outweigh risks
  - **UKMEC 3:** Risks generally outweigh benefits, for example:
    - Smokers aged over 35 years with less than 15 cigarettes a day
    - BMI > 35 kg/m²
    - Family history of VTE in first-degree relatives under 45 years
    - Controlled hypertension
    - Immobility (e.g., wheelchair use)
    - BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation
  - **UKMEC 4:** Unacceptable health risk, for example:
    - Smokers aged over 35 years with more than 15 cigarettes a day
    - Migraine with aura
    - History of VTE, stroke, or ischemic heart disease
    - Breast cancer

### Progesterone Only Pill (POP)

- Contains only progesterone
- Prevents pregnancy by thickening cervical mucus
- Suitable for those who cannot use or tolerate COCP
- Timing of initiation:
  - Start within the first five days of the cycle for immediate protection
  - Use condoms for the first 2 days if started at another time
- Types of POP:
  - **3-Hour Pill:** Traditional POP, take within 3 hours of the same time daily
  - **12-Hour Pill:** Desogestrel POP, take within 12 hours of the same time daily
- Missed pill protocol:
  - Take missed pill as soon as possible
  - Continue the rest of the pack normally
  - Use condoms for 48 hours after pill-taking is re-established
  - Consider emergency contraception for multiple missed days
- Side effects:
  - Irregular bleeding
  - Mood changes
  - Breast tenderness
  - Headaches (typically cease after a few months)

## Pre-Pill Investigations

Prior to initiating oral contraceptive therapy, it is important to:

- Utilize UKMEC to establish safety by:
  - Measuring blood pressure
  - Calculating Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Exclude the possibility of pregnancy:
  - A pregnancy test may be required

## Oral Contraceptive Management

### Prescribing

- Initially prescribe COCP or POP for a 3-month trial
- Schedule a follow-up appointment after the initial period
- Subsequent prescriptions may extend for 6 or 12 months

### Non-Prescribing Advice

Provide comprehensive guidance on:

- Proper pill initiation
- Management of missed pills
- Managing potential side effects of diarrhea and vomiting
- Awareness of drug interactions
- Understanding side effects and recognizing symptoms of VTE

Additionally, offer written information through an information leaflet and advise an appointment in 3 months or sooner if concerns arise. Blood pressure and side effects should be discussed during follow-up. Regular check-ups should continue every six months.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! According to UKMEC, individuals with a BMI > 35 kg/m² fall under category 3, indicating that the risks generally outweigh the benefits, but COCP can be considered after a careful evaluation of other factors.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Incorrect. Consider the patient's BMI and how it influences the UKMEC category for COCP use."
