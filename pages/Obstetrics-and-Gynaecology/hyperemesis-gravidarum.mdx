# Hyperemesis Gravidarum: Comprehensive Management

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting that affects approximately 1% of pregnant individuals, typically arising between weeks 7 and 12 and occasionally persisting until week 20. The condition is often attributed to elevated levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).

## Understanding Hyperemesis Gravidarum

### Diagnosis Criteria

The diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum is based on the presence of the following clinical features:

- Persistent and severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy
- Evidence of dehydration, characterized by:
  - Dry mucous membranes
  - Postural dizziness
  - Tachycardia
  - Hypotension
- Electrolyte imbalances
- Weight loss exceeding 5% of the pre-pregnancy weight
- Presence of ketosis

### Risk Factors

Certain factors increase the likelihood of experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum:

- A family history of the condition
- Previous episodes of nausea and vomiting in pregnancies
- Conditions associated with increased placental mass, such as:
  - Multiple gestations
  - Gestational trophoblastic disease
  - Trisomy 21 or 18
- Carrying a female fetus

## Evaluating the Condition

### Initial Investigations

Upon the first episode of severe nausea and vomiting, the following assessments should be conducted:

- **Blood Tests:**
  - Full Blood Count (FBC): Typically normal
  - Urea and Electrolytes (U&E): May indicate electrolyte imbalances
  - Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Usually normal
  - Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs): Can reveal hypo- or hyperthyroidism
- **Urine Analysis:**
  - Checks for ketonuria and elevated specific gravity
  - Helps exclude urinary tract infection (UTI)
- **Ultrasound Scan:**
  - Confirms the viability of an intrauterine pregnancy
  - Assesses for multiple pregnancies and trophoblastic disease

Repeated episodes of hyperemesis gravidarum do not necessitate redoing TFTs or an ultrasound if initial results were normal.

## Management Strategies

### Clinical Interventions

Effective management of hyperemesis gravidarum typically requires hospitalization and includes:

- **Intravenous (IV) Rehydration:**
  - Hartmann's solution is the first-line fluid
  - Fluid therapy should address deficit, ongoing losses, and daily maintenance
- **Anti-emetic Medication:**
  - **First-line Options:**
    - Cyclizine: 50 mg orally (PO), intramuscularly (IM), or IV every 8 hours
    - Prochlorperazine: 5–10 mg PO 6–8 hourly; 12.5 mg IM/IV 8 hourly; 25 mg per rectum (PR) daily
    - Promethazine: 12.5–25 mg PO, IM, IV, or PR every 4–8 hours
    - Chlorpromazine: 10–25 mg PO, IV, or IM every 4–6 hours; or 50–100 mg PR every 6–8 hours
  - **Second-line Options:**
    - Metoclopramide: 5–10 mg PO, IV, or IM every 8 hours (maximum duration of 5 days)
    - Domperidone: 10 mg PO every 8 hours; 30–60 mg PR every 8 hours
    - Ondansetron: 4–8 mg PO every 6–8 hours; 8 mg IV over 15 minutes every 12 hours
  - **Third-line Option:**
    - Corticosteroids: Start with hydrocortisone 100 mg twice daily IV, followed by oral prednisolone 40–50 mg daily, tapering to the lowest effective dose
- **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs):**
  - Omeprazole 20-40 mg IV once daily, alone or with anti-emetics

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** For prolonged admissions, thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
</Callout>

Upon discharge, women should continue oral anti-emetics like metoclopramide and follow up with a consultant obstetrician after more than three admissions. Corticosteroids are a treatment option post-first trimester, due to the risk of cleft palate.

### Supportive Measures

Discharged patients should be advised to:

- Consume small, regular meals
- Opt for high-carbohydrate, low-fat foods
- Avoid triggers such as certain foods or smells
- Take ample rest
- Consider ginger as a natural remedy

  {
    question: "A 29-year-old female at 10 weeks gestation presents with persistent nausea and vomiting. She has lost 7% of her pre-pregnancy weight and appears dehydrated. Her blood pressure is 95/60 mmHg, and her pulse is 110 bpm. Initial investigations reveal ketonuria and hypokalemia. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line intervention for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Oral rehydration therapy and outpatient follow-up",
      "Intravenous (IV) rehydration with Hartmann's solution",
      "Immediate administration of oral corticosteroids",
      "Empirical antibiotics for presumed urinary tract infection",
      "Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient is presenting with signs of hyperemesis gravidarum, including dehydration, weight loss, and electrolyte imbalance. The first-line intervention is hospitalization for IV rehydration with Hartmann's solution to address the fluid deficit and ongoing losses.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the severity of dehydration and the need for immediate correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Which intervention is most urgently required?"
  },
  {
    question: "A pregnant patient with hyperemesis gravidarum has been admitted multiple times for IV rehydration and anti-emetic therapy. Despite treatment, she continues to have severe nausea and vomiting. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
