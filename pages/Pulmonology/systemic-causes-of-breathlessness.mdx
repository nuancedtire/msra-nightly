# Understanding Key Pulmonary Conditions

## Respiratory Failure

### Overview of Respiratory Failure

- **Respiratory failure** is characterized by inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system.
- Defined by a hypoxia level of less than `8kPa`.

### Classification and Causes

Respiratory failure is classified into two types based on the levels of pCO₂:

- **Type 1 Respiratory Failure** (`pCO₂` is low or normal):
  - Often results from ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.
  - Common conditions include:
    - Pneumonia
    - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
    - Pulmonary oedema
    - Moderate to severe asthma exacerbation

- **Type 2 Respiratory Failure** (`pCO₂` is high):
  - Caused by alveolar hypoventilation, possibly with V/Q mismatch.
  - Conditions leading to this include:
    - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
    - Obstructive sleep apnoea
    - Severe asthma exacerbations
    - Neuromuscular diseases affecting respiratory muscles (e.g., myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome)
    - Sedative drugs that cause respiratory depression

## Sarcoidosis

### Introduction to Sarcoidosis

- **Sarcoidosis** is a multisystem, granulomatous disease.
- The cause is unknown, and it often affects the lungs.
- Predominantly seen in individuals of Scandinavian and Afro-Caribbean descent.

### Diagnosis Considerations

- No definitive test; diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic findings.
- **Lofgren syndrome** is a telltale acute form of sarcoidosis, featuring:
  - Erythema nodosum
  - Bihilar lymphadenopathy
  - Uveitis, arthritis, or parotitis

For chronic sarcoidosis, the following may suggest the diagnosis:

- Negative tuberculin test
- Elevated serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)
- Hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia
- Positive tissue biopsy

## Legionnaires’ Disease

### Understanding Legionnaires’ Disease

- Caused by *Legionella Pneumophila*.
- Transmission occurs through inhalation of aerosolized water from aquatic systems.

### Clinical Presentation

- Often presents after travel abroad or a cruise.
- Extrapulmonary symptoms may include:
  - Bradycardia
  - Gastrointestinal issues

### Diagnostic Approach

First-line investigations for Legionnaires’ disease:

- **Sputum cultures**: Most accurate.
- **Urinary antigen tests**: May have limitations.

## Pulmonary Hypertension

### Overview of Pulmonary Hypertension

- Has various causes, with **idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension** being the most common.
- There is a familial form with autosomal dominant inheritance but reduced penetrance.

### Treatment Modalities

Medications used in treatment include:

- Endothelin antagonists (e.g., bosentan)
- Prostacyclin analogues (e.g., iloprost)
- Phosphodiesterase V inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil)
