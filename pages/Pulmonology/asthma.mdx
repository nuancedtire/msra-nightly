# Understanding Asthma: Diagnosis, Management, and Emergency Care

Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways, characterized by episodic and reversible airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. This article provides a comprehensive overview of asthma, including its symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management strategies.

## Overview of Asthma

Asthma manifests through an array of symptoms following exposure to various triggers, such as cold air, exercise, allergens, COX-1 inhibitors like aspirin, and viral infections. Key symptoms include:

- Shortness of breath (dyspnoea)
- High-pitched wheezing
- Cough

These symptoms are typically intermittent, may intensify at night, and are often alleviated by bronchodilators or by avoiding triggers. Asthma commonly presents in childhood, with around 75% of diagnoses made during this period. A family history of atopic conditions is frequently observed in patients with asthma.

## Diagnosis of Asthma

### Clinical Presentation

Diagnosing asthma involves a review of respiratory symptoms that appear post-exposure to known triggers and exhibit airflow obstruction upon expiration. This obstruction is verified through spirometry testing. In situations where asthma is suspected but not confirmed, a treatment trial may be undertaken.

### Differential Diagnosis

Other conditions that may mimic asthma include:

- **COPD:** Persistent and irreversible airflow obstruction, typically in older patients with a history of smoking.
- Exertional dyspnoea
- Cardiac-related issues (cardiomyopathies, coronary artery disease, or pericarditis) if chest pain or cardiac symptoms are present
- Bronchial carcinoma
- Aspiration of a foreign body

### Pulmonary Function Testing

Spirometry is the cornerstone of asthma diagnosis:

- A reduced FEV₁/FVC ratio (usually < 0.7)
- Reversibility test: A significant increase in FEV₁ (≥ 12%) after bronchodilator administration indicates reversible airflow obstruction.
- Bronchoprovocation test with methacholine to induce bronchoconstriction when spirometry is inconclusive.

Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement is less reliable but can support a diagnosis when showing significant improvement post-bronchodilator administration.

### Additional Investigations

- Laboratory tests: Eosinophilia may suggest allergic asthma.
- Imaging: Chest X-ray (CXR) is typically normal in asthma cases.
- Allergy tests: While not diagnostic, they assist in identifying possible asthma triggers.

## Emergency Management of Asthma

### Identifying Severe Exacerbations

A severe asthma attack may present with:

- Rapid breathing (> 30 breaths/minute)
- Elevated heart rate (> 120 beats/minute)
- Visible use of accessory muscles for breathing
- Sweating and extreme dyspnoea
- Pulsus paradoxus

### Initial Assessment

In a respiratory distress scenario, evaluate:

- Peak expiratory flow
- Pulse oximetry
- Arterial blood gas (ABG) for hypoxaemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg or SpO2 < 90%)

Increased respiratory drive leading to initial hyperventilation and hypocapnia, followed by hypercapnia if obstruction persists, is typical in acute attacks.

### Emergency Treatment

1. Relieving airflow obstruction with inhaled bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticoids (effects noticeable after ~6 hours).
2. Addressing hypoxaemia with supplemental oxygen, usually via a nasal cannula.

Patients may be discharged if symptoms resolve and PEF exceeds 80% of the predicted value within an hour post-treatment.

## Asthma Management

### Pharmacological Approaches

Treatment is tailored according to asthma severity and control:

- **Intermittent Asthma:** As-needed inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (SABA).
- **Mild Persistent Asthma:** SABA plus a low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid or leukotriene modifier.
- **Moderate Persistent Asthma:** SABA plus a medium-dose inhaled glucocorticoid or a low-dose combination with a LABA or LAMA.
- **Severe Persistent Asthma:** Medium to high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid with LABA, potentially adding leukotriene modifiers, LAMA, or biologic therapies.

### Non-Pharmacological Strategies

Crucial to asthma management is:

- Routine pulmonary function monitoring
- Medication review
- Patient education on proper inhaler use and trigger avoidance
- Home PEF monitoring

    question: "A 13-year-old boy with a history of atopic dermatitis presents with recurrent episodes of wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, especially at night. His symptoms often intensify after playing outside in cold weather. His physical exam is unremarkable when he is asymptomatic. Which of the following tests is most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in this patient?",
