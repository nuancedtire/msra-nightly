# Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Diagnosis and Management

## Overview

Acute **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)** is a type of **Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)** characterized by the blockage of the pulmonary artery or its branches by substances such as thrombus, tumor, air, or fat that originate elsewhere in the body. Its pathogenesis mirrors that of deep venous thrombosis, with most emboli originating from the proximal veins of the lower extremities, such as the iliac, femoral, and popliteal veins. PE is a prevalent and serious medical condition globally, with a mortality rate in England and Wales ranging from 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually.

## Diagnosis

The clinical presentation of PE varies depending on the size, number, and distribution of the emboli. Small emboli may remain asymptomatic, while large emboli can be fatal.

### Symptoms
- Acute breathlessness
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Haemoptysis
- Dizziness
- Syncope

### Signs
- Pyrexia
- Cyanosis
- Tachypnoea
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension
- Raised Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP)
- Pleural rub
- Pleural effusion
- Concurrently swollen lower limb

Diagnosing PE based solely on symptoms and signs can be challenging. Risk factors for **Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)** assist in guiding diagnosis and management:

- Recent surgery (especially abdominal/pelvic or hip/knee replacement)
- Thrombophilia (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome)
- Leg fracture
- Prolonged bed rest/reduced mobility
- Malignancy
- Pregnancy/postpartum; use of contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy
- Previous PE

**Wells' Criteria** provides a structured approach to assess PE risk:

| Feature | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT | 3 |
| PE is the `#1` diagnosis OR equally likely diagnosis | 3 |
| Heart rate `>100` | 1.5 |
| Immobilization for at least 3 days OR surgery in the previous 4 weeks | 1.5 |
| Previous, objectively diagnosed PE or DVT | 1.5 |
| Haemoptysis | 1 |
| Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative | 1 |

**Total Wells' Score:**
- `4` or less – PE unlikely. Consider D-dimer to rule out PE.
- `4` or more – PE likely, consider diagnostic imaging.

## Investigations

**CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)** is the preferred first-line imaging for confirming PE diagnosis due to its high sensitivity and specificity. If CTPA is unavailable, a Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) scan can be used.

**Serum D-dimers** are sensitive but not specific to PE, as they can elevate due to thrombosis, inflammation, infection, malignancy, or postoperative status. They should only be performed in patients with low PE probability (`Wells <4`). A negative D-dimer test effectively rules out PE in low or intermediate probability cases, eliminating the need for imaging. For high probability cases (`Wells >4`), obtain a CTPA regardless of the D-dimer result.

### Additional Investigations
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**
- **Chest X-ray**
- **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Analysis**

## Management of Emergencies

**Hemodynamically unstable PE**, also known as "massive" or "high-risk" PE, results in hypotension. It is defined as a systolic blood pressure `<90 mmHg` or a drop of `≥40 mmHg` from baseline for `>15 minutes`. This condition requires immediate medical attention, as mortality risk is highest within the first two hours of presentation and remains elevated for up to 72 hours.

**Management Protocol:**
- Administer immediate thrombolysis (50 mg bolus of alteplase).
- Establish IV access, resuscitate, and commence heparin (either Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated).
- Initiate rapid colloid infusion if systolic BP is `<90 mmHg` and seek ICU input for potential further fluid bolus or vasopressor use.

## Acute Management

**Respiratory Support**: Provide supplemental oxygen to maintain `SpO₂` at `94-98%` (or `88-92%` in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with chronic CO₂ retention).

### Stable Patients

For hemodynamically stable patients, treat with oral or parenteral anticoagulation. Patients without additional risk factors may be managed as outpatients.

**First-line Treatment**: Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) like apixaban or rivaroxaban, which can be started immediately without prior parenteral treatment. Dabigatran and edoxaban require `5 days` of LMWH before initiation.

**When DOACs are contraindicated**: Use LMWH and warfarin bridging. LMWH is given as a stat dose, and warfarin is started. Continue LMWH for at least `5 days` or until the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is `≥2` in two consecutive readings, then continue warfarin for at least `3 months`.

### Unstable Patients

In cases of life-threatening shock due to acute PE (first or recurrent event) and low bleeding risk, systemic thrombolytic therapy with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is recommended, followed by anticoagulation. Thrombolytic agents include recombinant tPA (e.g., alteplase, tenecteplase), streptokinase (SK), and recombinant human urokinase (UK).

**Absolute Contraindications** to thrombolytic therapy:
- Intracranial neoplasm
- Recent (`<2 months`) intracranial or spinal trauma/surgery
- History of haemorrhagic stroke
- Active bleeding or bleeding diathesis (e.g., severe thrombocytopenia)
- Non-haemorrhagic stroke within the past three months

**Relative Contraindications**:
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP `>200 mmHg` or diastolic BP `>110 mmHg`)
- Non-haemorrhagic stroke more than three months prior
- Surgery within the past 10 days
- Pregnancy

**Embolectomy** is indicated for hemodynamically unstable PE patients contraindicated for thrombolytic therapy or those failing thrombolysis. It can be performed surgically or via catheter, depending on expertise, diagnosis, and anticipated response.

## Long-term Management

Treatment duration with oral medication ranges from 3-6 months:
- `3 months` for PE with a known cause
- `6 months` if no known cause
- Longer if recurrent emboli or underlying malignancy

**Warfarin** is dosed according to INR. **DOAC dosing** is as follows:

- **Apixaban**: 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for at least 3 months.
- **Rivaroxaban**: 15 mg twice daily (days 1–21), then 20 mg once daily for at least 3 months.
- **Dabigatran**: 
  - 150 mg twice daily (ages 18–74) for at least 3 months.
  - 110 to 150 mg twice daily (ages 75–79) for at least 3 months.
  - 110 mg twice daily (ages 80+) for at least 3 months.
- **Edoxaban**: 
  - 60 mg once daily for at least 3 months.
  - 30 mg once daily for 3 months in patients with body weight ≤60 kg, moderate/severe renal impairment, or taking a P-glycoprotein inhibitor (e.g., ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin, or ketoconazole).

**Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) Filters** are used for VTE treatment when anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, failed, or in patients with limited ability to tolerate further PE (e.g., acute hemodynamically massive PE).

*Following treatment with LMWH for `5 days`.
