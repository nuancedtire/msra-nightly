# Understanding Lung Cancer: Types, Diagnosis, and Management

Lung cancer, also known as bronchogenic carcinoma, is a collective term for malignancies that arise from the airways or the lung tissue itself. It is primarily classified into two main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which together account for about 95% of all cases. This classification is crucial for determining the stage of the disease and deciding on the appropriate treatment and prognosis. NSCLC includes subtypes such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, while other less common types constitute around 5% of lung cancers.

## Diagnosis of Lung Cancer

Lung cancer diagnosis often occurs at advanced stages, and its symptoms can be attributed to intrathoracic effects, extrathoracic metastasis, or paraneoplastic phenomena.

### Intrathoracic Effects

- **Cough:**
  - An emergent investigation is warranted if a current or former smoker develops a new cough.
- **Haemoptysis**
- **Chest Pain**
- **Dyspnoea**
- **Hoarseness:**
  - This symptom indicates tumor involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
- **Pleural Disease:**
  - Malignant pleural effusion is a common pleural affliction in lung cancer patients.
- **Pancoast Syndrome:**
  - A form of lung cancer located in the superior sulcus, it can lead to shoulder pain, Horner syndrome, bone destruction, and muscle atrophy in the hand.

### Extrathoracic Metastasis

Affected organs typically include:
- Liver
- Bones
- Brain
- Adrenal glands

### Paraneoplastic Phenomena

These are the distant effects of the tumor unrelated to invasion or metastasis:
- **Hypercalcemia:**
  - May result from bone metastasis or tumor secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP).
- **Cushing Syndrome:**
  - Caused by ectopic ACTH production.
- **SIADH Secretion:**
  - Commonly associated with SCLC, leading to hyponatremia.
- **Neurologic Syndromes:**
  - Conditions like Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and cerebellar ataxia fall under this category.

### Risk Factors

Identifying risk factors aids in lung cancer diagnosis:
- *Primary Risk Factor:*
  - Cigarette smoking, accountable for approximately 90% of lung cancer cases.
- *Other Risk Factors Include:*
  - Radiation therapy
  - Environmental toxins (e.g., asbestos, radon)
  - Pulmonary fibrosis
  - Alcohol consumption
  - HIV infection
  - Family history of lung cancer

## Investigations

When suspecting lung cancer, the following laboratory and radiological investigations are essential:

### Laboratory Tests

- Full blood count
- Urea and Electrolytes
- Calcium levels
- Alkaline phosphatase
- Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin)
- Creatinine

### Radiological Investigations

- **Preferred Imaging:**
  - CT scans of the chest, lower neck, and upper abdomen with IV contrast to assess the primary tumor and possible spread.

### Biopsy

- **NSCLC Diagnosis:**
  - Pathologic evaluation of cytologic (e.g., pleural fluid) or histopathologic (e.g., tissue biopsy) specimens is required.

Investigations aim to facilitate accurate staging using the Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) system and to inform treatment planning, often discussed in a multi-disciplinary team setting.

SCLC is staged as either limited (confined to one side of the chest) or extensive (any more widespread disease).

## Management of Lung Cancer

### NSCLC Management

#### Prescribing

- **Late-Stage Disease (III or IV):**
  - Aim to alleviate symptoms due to local or metastatic tumors.
  - Treatment depends on the NSCLC subtype, molecular genotype, and PD-L1 status.
  - Options include chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Cisplatin, gemcitabine) and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) for EGFR mutation cases.

#### Non-Prescribing

- **Early-Stage Disease (I-II):**
  - Surgery with curative intent, such as lobectomy, is indicated and often involves hilar and mediastinal lymph node sampling or resection.
  - Thoracotomy or minimally invasive techniques (e.g., video-assisted thoracic surgery) are used to access the chest.

### SCLC Management

#### Prescribing

- **Limited-Stage:**
  - Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy are typical, with regimens like cisplatin and etoposide.
- **Extensive-Stage:**
  - Chemotherapy, generally 4 to 6 cycles, with regimens such as cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin and etoposide.

#### Non-Prescribing

- Surgery is rarely an option in SCLC treatment.
