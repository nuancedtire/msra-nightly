# Management and Diagnosis of Tension Pneumothorax

Tension pneumothorax occurs due to the progressive accumulation of air in the pleural space. This can result from a traumatic laceration to the chest wall, airway, or lung, forming a one-way valve. This valve allows air to enter the pleural space during inspiration but prevents its exit during expiration. The most frequent cause of tension pneumothorax is mechanical ventilation of a patient with a simple pneumothorax before inserting a chest drain. Other causes include blunt trauma, penetrating injuries, central venous catheter placement, and lung biopsy. The accumulated air leads to ipsilateral lung collapse and hypoxia, a mediastinal shift to the opposite side, and impaired venous return to the heart. These factors can cause a traumatic arrest, making it a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment.

## Diagnosis

Patients with tension pneumothorax may experience chest pain and display the following classic signs:

- Tachypnoea
- Tachycardia
- Raised `JVP` and distended neck veins
- Pulsus paradoxus
- Reduced breath sounds on the affected side
- Hyper-resonance to percussion on the affected side
- Decreased chest movement
- Tracheal deviation away from the affected side
- Hypotension and potential loss of consciousness if severe

These symptoms can overlap with conditions like cardiac tamponade or diaphragmatic injuries, which need to be ruled out.

## Investigations

A delay in imaging can be fatal; hence, tension pneumothorax should be primarily diagnosed clinically. However, if the patient is stable and imaging is immediately available, it can confirm the diagnosis. Chest radiographs may show hemi-diaphragmatic depression, ipsilateral flattening of the heart border, and contralateral mediastinal deviation.

## Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

Tension pneumothorax is a critical emergency. If not managed promptly, it may lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest. In the event of cardiac arrest, perform a needle decompression as part of resuscitation to restore cardiac output.

## Management (Prescribing)

- Administer high-flow oxygen targeting `SpO₂ >96%`.
- Provide adequate analgesia, such as morphine.
- Consider prophylactic antibiotics, like broad-spectrum cephalosporins, to prevent pneumonia or empyema post-chest drain insertion, especially in cases of severe blunt or penetrating chest trauma.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Immediate chest decompression is necessary if the following conditions are present and chest radiography is unavailable:

- `Systolic BP <90 mmHg`
- `Respiratory rate <10/min`
- `SpO₂ <92%` on oxygen
- Reduced consciousness while on oxygen
- Cardiac arrest

According to ATLS guidelines, insert a cannula into the 4th or 5th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line for immediate decompression. This method is more reliable than the previously recommended second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. Current Resuscitation Council guidelines endorse both techniques.

**Note:** A rush of air confirms the diagnosis, converting a tension pneumothorax to a simple pneumothorax.

If unsuccessful, insert a chest drain into the pleural space within the safe triangle—bordered by the lateral pectoralis major, anterior latissimus dorsi, and above the nipple base line, with the apex in the axilla. Leave the tube in place until no air escapes and a chest x-ray confirms lung re-expansion. If air leakage persists after 2-4 days, surgery may be necessary.

    question: "A 34-year-old male presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain and dyspnea following a motor vehicle accident. On examination, he has decreased breath sounds on the right side, tracheal deviation to the left, and distended neck veins. What is the immediate next step in the management of this patient?",

      "Obtain a chest X-ray",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The clinical presentation suggests a tension pneumothorax, which is a medical emergency. Immediate needle decompression is required to relieve the pressure in the pleural space.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the need for immediate intervention in a suspected tension pneumothorax. What procedure can rapidly relieve the pressure in this emergency situation?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a suspected tension pneumothorax is being managed in the emergency department. Which of the following clinical signs is expected in this condition?",
    options: [
      "Tracheal deviation towards the affected side",
      "Bilateral wheezing",
      "Hyper-resonance to percussion on the affected side",
      "Bradycardia",
      "Normal jugular venous pressure"

    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Hyper-resonance to percussion on the affected side is a classic sign of tension pneumothorax due to the accumulation of air in the pleural space.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the physical examination findings that occur due to air trapping in the pleural space. Which sign is indicative of this?"
  },
  {
    question: "During the management of a tension pneumothorax, a needle decompression is performed in the 5th intercostal space, mid-axillary line. What is the rationale for choosing this site over the second intercostal space, mid-clavicular line?",
    options: [
      "Reduced risk of damaging the lung",
      "Increased reliability in decompressing the pleural space",
      "Easier access in obese patients",
      "Lower risk of hitting the heart",
      "Less painful for the patient"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The 5th intercostal space in the mid-axillary line is more reliable for decompression due to more consistent penetration of the pleural space compared to the second intercostal space.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which anatomical site provides consistent access to the pleural space, thus ensuring effective decompression."

    question: "A 45-year-old woman is undergoing treatment for a tension pneumothorax. After initial needle decompression, a chest drain is inserted. What is the purpose of leaving the chest drain in place until no air escapes and a chest X-ray confirms lung re-expansion?",
    options: [
      "To prevent re-inflation of the affected lung",
      "To allow for continuous monitoring of pleural pressure",
