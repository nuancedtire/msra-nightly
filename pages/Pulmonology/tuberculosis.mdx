# Tuberculosis: Understanding the Disease, Diagnosis, and Management

Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection primarily affecting the lungs and caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. It stands as the most fatal bacterial infection worldwide, with an estimated 30% of the global population harboring latent TB. High prevalence rates are noted in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbated by malnutrition and densely populated living conditions.

## Stages of Tuberculosis

TB develops through two distinct stages, primary and secondary.

### Primary Tuberculosis

- Initial exposure to _M. tuberculosis_ leads to a small lung lesion, known as a Ghon focus.
- The lesion primarily consists of macrophages and may progress to a granuloma with caseating necrosis.
- Formation of a Ghon complex occurs if there is concurrent hilar lymph node involvement.
- In most cases, the Ghon focus becomes fibrotic, leading to latent TB.
- Immunocompromised individuals may develop disseminated TB or miliary tuberculosis.

### Secondary Tuberculosis

- Occurs when a latent infection is reactivated, typically due to a weakened immune system.
- Reactivation often begins at the lung's apex, potentially spreading to other organs.
- Secondary TB can affect various sites including:
  - Gastrointestinal (GI) tract
  - Central Nervous System (CNS), resulting in tuberculous meningitis
  - Vertebral bodies, leading to Pott’s disease
  - Kidneys
  - Pericardium

## Diagnosis

TB spreads through respiratory droplets, requiring prolonged exposure for transmission. Symptoms can persist for weeks or months and may include:

- Unintended weight loss
- Persistent fever
- Night sweats
- Lack of appetite (anorexia)
- Cough, sometimes with blood (haemoptysis)
- Shortness of breath (dyspnoea)
- Firm, non-tender enlarged lymph nodes, especially cervical and supraclavicular
- CNS TB presents with headaches
- Pott’s disease manifests as backache
- Addison’s disease symptoms

## Investigations

TB screening and diagnosis involve multiple methods:

### Mantoux Test

- Intradermal injection of purified protein derivative, with results read 2-3 days later.
- Induration diameters are interpreted as follows:
  - `<6mm` indicates no exposure to TB, candidate for BCG vaccine.
  - `6-15mm` may suggest prior BCG vaccination or TB infection.
  - `>15mm` strongly indicates TB infection.
  
### Sputum Cultures

- Three morning sputum samples are recommended for active TB, though results may take up to 6 weeks.
- Up to 20% of active cases may yield negative cultures.

### Additional Diagnostic Methods

- Ziehl – Neelsen staining is commonly used to identify _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.
- Nucleic acid amplification offers rapid, accurate testing but is costly and not universally recommended.
- Imaging such as chest radiograph and CT scans can reveal lung consolidation, lymphadenopathy, and cavities, especially in the upper lobes.

**Warning:** TB is a notifiable disease. Suspected cases should be promptly reported and managed as presumed positive.

## Management

Treating TB is challenging due to the bacterium's slow growth and robust cell wall.

### Prescribing Management

- Initial 2-month treatment involves rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.
- The following 4 months require continued rifampicin and isoniazid.
- Extra-pulmonary TB, such as meningeal TB, necessitates a total of 12 months of treatment.
- *Isoniazid treatment is supplemented with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) to avert peripheral neuropathy.*

### Non-Prescribing Management

- Surgical interventions may be needed for miliary TB or Pott’s disease.
- Directly observed therapy is beneficial for patients with poor adherence histories, ensuring compliance.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 33-year-old male presents with a 3-week history of productive cough, night sweats, and a 10-pound weight loss. On examination, he exhibits cervical lymphadenopathy and a positive Mantoux test with an induration of 18mm. A chest radiograph shows a fibrotic lesion in the right upper lobe with hilar lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely stage of tuberculosis in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Primary tuberculosis without lymph node involvement",
      "Secondary tuberculosis with reactivation at the lung apex",
      "Latent tuberculosis infection without active disease",
      "Primary tuberculosis with formation of a Ghon complex",
      "Disseminated miliary tuberculosis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's presentation of a productive cough, weight loss, and night sweats, along with a positive Mantoux test and radiographic evidence of a fibrotic lesion with hilar lymphadenopathy, is indicative of primary tuberculosis with formation of a Ghon complex.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's symptoms, Mantoux test results, and radiographic findings when determining the stage of tuberculosis. Recall the characteristics of a Ghon complex."
  },
  {
    question: "A 25-year-old woman with a history of HIV infection presents with a chronic headache and fever. A lumbar puncture is performed, and the CSF analysis is consistent with tuberculous meningitis. Which of the following is the most appropriate duration for her anti-tubercular treatment regimen?",
    options: [
      "2 months of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by 4 months of rifampicin and isoniazid",
      "12 months of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol",
      "6 months of rifampicin and isoniazid only",
      "12 months of rifampicin and isoniazid",
      "9 months of rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Extra-pulmonary TB, such as meningeal TB, necessitates a longer treatment duration, a total of 12 months, to ensure complete eradication of the infection.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the special considerations for extra-pulmonary TB, particularly involving the central nervous system, and the recommended treatment duration for such cases."
