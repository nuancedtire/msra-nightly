# Understanding Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP)

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is defined as pneumonia that emerges 48 hours or more after hospital admission, without being present at the time of admission.

## Overview

HAP is one of the most prevalent hospital-acquired infections, with the majority of cases occurring in non-ventilated patients. However, the risk is highest among those receiving mechanical ventilation.

### Pathogenesis

The development of HAP depends on the number and virulence of microorganisms entering the lower respiratory tract and the host's response. The primary route of infection is microaspiration of organisms colonizing the oropharyngeal or, less frequently, the gastrointestinal tract.

### Causative Pathogens

HAP can be caused by various pathogens, often being polymicrobial. Commonly implicated pathogens include:

| Gram-negative           | Gram-positive                           |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Escherichia coli        | Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA)  |
| Klebsiella pneumoniae   | Streptococcus spp                       |
| Enterobacter spp        |                                         |
| Pseudomonas aeruginosa  |                                         |
| Acinetobacter spp       |                                         |

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing HAP can be challenging due to its non-specific clinical features. According to the American Thoracic Society, a clinical diagnosis involves a new lung infiltrate combined with clinical evidence of infection, such as fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and declining oxygenation.

### Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**

- Fever
- Rigor
- Malaise
- Anorexia
- Dyspnea
- Cough
- Purulent sputum
- Hemoptysis
- Pleuritic chest pain

**Signs:**

- Pyrexia (hypothermia in the elderly)
- Cyanosis
- Confusion (especially in the elderly)
- Tachypnea
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension
- Signs of consolidation (e.g., diminished expansion, dull percussion note)
- Pleural rub

### Risk Factors

Assessing a patient's risk factors can aid in diagnosis:

- Inadequate infection control/hand hygiene
- Bed head angle `<30°`
- Intubation and mechanical ventilation
- Endotracheal cuff pressure `<20 cm H2O`
- **H2** antagonist and antacid use
- Poor oral hygiene
- Continuous sedation
- Reintubation

## Investigations

### First-line Investigations

#### Chest X-ray

- Essential for suspected HAP
- Prefer PA and lateral views over AP
- Compare with earlier films if possible
- Look for opacity or blurring of diaphragm/heart border

#### WBC Count with Differential

- Non-specific but elevated or decreased WBCs can indicate infection

#### Pulse Oximetry

- Values `<92%` suggest severe cases requiring escalated care

#### Sputum Sample

- Perform non-invasive sampling, such as endotracheal aspiration

### Additional Investigations

#### Arterial Blood Gas

- Checks for hypoxia, respiratory failure, or acid-base disturbances

#### CT Chest

- Clarifies diagnosis and may indicate further procedures

## Management of HAP

### Antibiotic Therapy

Prompt and appropriate antibiotic administration is crucial. Treatment regimens rely on local antimicrobial resistance data and the presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen risk factors.

<details>
<summary>Risk Factors for MDR Pathogens</summary>

- Antibiotic use in the past 90 days
- Septic shock during ventilator-associated pneumonia
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) before pneumonia
- Hospitalization over 5 days before pneumonia onset
- Acute renal replacement therapy prior to pneumonia

</details>

#### Adults (18 Years and Over)

- **Non-severe Cases:** Co-amoxiclav is preferred unless allergic.
- **Severe Cases or High Resistance Risk:** Use Piperacillin with tazobactam or alternatives like Ceftazidime, Ceftriaxone, and Meropenem.
- **MRSA Suspected/Confirmed:** Add Vancomycin, Teicoplanin, or Linezolid.

#### Children and Young People (Under 18 Years)

- **Under 1 Month:** Base antibiotic choice on specialist advice.
- **Aged 1 Month and Over:** Co-amoxiclav is preferred, with Clarithromycin as an alternative.
- **Severe Cases or High Resistance Risk:** Options include Piperacillin with tazobactam or Ceftazidime.

### Non-Prescribing Management

- Intubation and invasive ventilation for respiratory failure
- Consider bronchoscopy or thoracentesis if recovery is slow
- Encourage influenza vaccination
- Maintain rigorous hand hygiene to prevent MDR pathogen transmission
