# Understanding Bronchitis

Bronchitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the bronchi within the lower respiratory system. Its primary symptom is a cough, with or without sputum production, typically resolving within a few weeks. In contrast, chronic bronchitis involves a persistent cough for three months or longer. Bronchitis cases increase during colder seasons and may follow an upper respiratory infection. Though infrequent, complications such as superinfection or pneumonia can arise.

## Causes of Bronchitis

Viral infections are the predominant cause of bronchitis. The most common viral pathogens include:

- Influenza
- Parainfluenza
- Human metapneumovirus
- Rhinovirus
- Coronavirus
- Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

Notably, bacterial infections can also lead to bronchitis, with the most frequent bacterial pathogens being:

- Bordetella pertussis
- Mycoplasma pneumoniae
- Chlamydia pneumoniae

## Diagnosis of Bronchitis

The diagnosis of bronchitis is largely based on clinical presentation, particularly when a patient exhibits a persistent cough for one to three weeks without signs of pneumonia like fever or dullness upon percussion. During auscultation, wheezing and rhonchi may be audible, with rhonchi often clearing after coughing. Further investigation is warranted if pneumonia is suspected or if there is potential for an influenza infection, which could necessitate antiviral therapy. Influenza is identified by a cough combined with a rapid onset of high fever.

Differential diagnoses to consider:

- **Pneumonia:** Cough with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, signs of consolidation, and mental status changes in older adults
- **Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD):** Cough may be the sole symptom
- **Asthma:** Wheezing, cough, and shortness of breath triggered by specific stimuli
- **ACE inhibitors:** Characterized by a persistent, dry cough
- **Heart failure:** Accompanied by cough and shortness of breath
- **Pulmonary embolism:** Presents with cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and chest pain, along with increased respiratory and heart rates

## Investigations

A chest X-ray may be indicated for suspected pneumonia. Microbiology tests are generally unnecessary unless there's concern for influenza or pertussis, particularly in high-risk or hospitalized patients. Procalcitonin tests can help differentiate bacterial from viral infections.

## Management (Prescribing)

Symptomatic treatment can include over-the-counter cough medications and NSAIDs, which may alleviate associated myalgia in influenza cases. Misuse of antibiotics in acute bronchitis, predominantly viral, is a concern. However, specific instances warrant antimicrobial therapy:

- **Bordetella pertussis:** Macrolides are recommended for a cough lasting under three weeks or for pregnant women with a cough under six weeks.
- **Influenza:** Antiviral treatment is typically for hospitalized patients or those at risk of complications. Neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir or zanamivir are first-line options.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Symptom management is key, as bronchitis symptoms are often self-limiting. Non-pharmacological remedies such as throat lozenges or honey can be recommended. Additionally, smokers should be advised to quit.

Non-pharmacological strategies are essential in managing the discomfort caused by bronchitis. Besides lozenges and honey, staying hydrated and using a humidifier may provide relief.

  {
    question: "A 45-year-old smoker presents with a two-week history of cough and sputum production. He has no fever, chest pain, or weight loss. His heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal limits. A chest X-ray shows no signs of consolidation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Pneumonia",
      "Acute bronchitis",
      "Pulmonary embolism",
      "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)",
      "Heart failure"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's history of smoking, cough, and sputum production without fever or signs of consolidation on the chest X-ray is consistent with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's symptoms and signs including cough, sputum production, and absence of fever or consolidation on chest X-ray. Which condition commonly presents with these features?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 30-year-old woman presents with a persistent cough that began after an upper respiratory infection. She reports no significant medical history and is not on any medications. On examination, you note rhonchi that clear after coughing. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Prescribe a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics",
      "Recommend over-the-counter cough medications and NSAIDs",
      "Order a procalcitonin test to differentiate bacterial from viral infection",
      "Perform a spirometry test to evaluate for asthma",
      "Start an antiviral therapy assuming influenza infection"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Symptomatic treatment with over-the-counter cough medications and NSAIDs is appropriate for this patient with bronchitis, given the absence of pneumonia or high-risk features for complications.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that the management of bronchitis without signs of pneumonia or high risk for complications primarily involves symptomatic treatment. What are common non-prescription remedies?"

    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Viral infections, particularly influenza, are the predominant cause of bronchitis, which often presents with increased incidence during colder seasons.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the most common causes of bronchitis, especially those that tend to increase in prevalence during the colder months. Which pathogen is most frequently responsible?"

    question: "A 25-year-old male with a cough lasting two weeks is diagnosed with bronchitis. He is otherwise healthy and reports no recent contact with sick individuals or travel. What is the most appropriate antibiotic therapy if a Bordetella pertussis infection is suspected?",
