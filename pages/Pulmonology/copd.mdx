# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Diagnosis and Management

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a commonly diagnosed progressive lung disease, primarily induced by cigarette smoking. It is characterized by symptoms such as shortness of breath and a chronic cough, which progressively worsen and impair the patient’s quality of life. Although symptom management can provide relief and mitigate exacerbations, cessation of smoking is the singular intervention that can arrest the progression of COPD.

## Diagnosis

Suspect COPD in individuals with significant smoking history exhibiting symptoms like progressive dyspnea or a chronic productive cough. Confirming the diagnosis requires demonstrating irreversible airflow obstruction via spirometry.

COPD patients may also present with:

- Decreased exercise tolerance.
- Wheezing.
- Persistent, progressively worsening dyspnea, contrasting the intermittent nature seen in asthma.

Key signs of COPD include:

- Tachypnea.
- Prolonged expiratory phase.
- Barrel-chested appearance.
- Accessory muscle use due to increased work of breathing.
- Wheezing.
- Basal crepitations.
- Indications of right heart failure, such as peripheral edema and raised jugular venous pressure.

While smoking remains the leading cause, COPD can also result from environmental and occupational exposures, as well as genetic disorders like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Screen for this deficiency if the patient is under 40 years old, has a minimal smoking history, a family history of the condition, or unexplained liver disease.

### Investigations

When COPD is suspected, conduct the following:

- **Spirometry**
  - An FEV1/FVC ratio `<70%` confirms airway obstruction.
  - Grade COPD severity by the FEV1 percentage of predicted.
  - Assess bronchodilation and steroid reversibility to distinguish COPD from asthma.
  - Increased lung volumes and functional residual capacities suggest emphysema.

- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**
  - While not diagnostic of COPD, CXR is critical for ruling out other pathologies.
  - Signs may include hyperinflation, a flattened diaphragm, and bullae.

- **Oxygen Saturation and Blood Gas Analysis**
  - Imperative when considering oxygen therapy.

- **Blood Tests**
  - Measure α1-antitrypsin levels if indicated.
  - Perform a full blood count (FBC).

- **Cardiac Assessments**
  - An ECG and echocardiogram are warranted if cor pulmonale is suspected.

## Management of Emergencies

COPD exacerbations can be life-threatening, characterized by an acute decline in symptoms and lung function, often triggered by respiratory infections. Differential diagnoses include pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary edema.

Management should encompass:

- Monitoring vital signs.
- Providing controlled oxygen therapy with a goal `SpO2` of `88-92%`.
- Ordering a blood gas, CXR, ECG, FBC, inflammatory markers, and U&Es.
- Administering bronchodilator nebulizers and short-term oral steroids.
- Considering antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.
- Utilizing non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory acidosis.
- Initiating early pulmonary rehabilitation.

### Non-Prescribing Management

The cornerstone of COPD management is smoking cessation, the only measure that modifies disease trajectory. Supplemental interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation and dietary adjustments can alleviate symptoms and enhance life quality. Vaccinations against pneumococcal infections and annual flu shots are also recommended. In select cases, surgical options like lung transplantation might be considered for younger patients with severe COPD.

### Prescribing Management

Commence with short-acting bronchodilators (SABA or SAMA) if non-pharmacological methods are insufficient.

- Prophylactic antibiotics and mucolytics like carbocysteine may be prescribed for chronic productive cough and recurrent exacerbations.

    question: "A 62-year-old man with a 45-pack-year smoking history presents with progressive shortness of breath, chronic productive cough, and decreased exercise tolerance. Spirometry reveals an FEV1/FVC ratio of 65%. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
