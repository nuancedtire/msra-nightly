# Aplastic Anaemia: Overview, Diagnosis and Management

Aplastic anaemia is a rare but serious medical condition that leads to the decreased production of blood cells. This article discusses the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of aplastic anaemia, particularly in children.

## Introduction

Aplastic anaemia is characterized by the destruction of bone marrow, resulting in a significant reduction in the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This condition is known as **pancytopenia**. It is usually observed in children and later in life after the age of 60. Aplastic anaemia affects all races and genders equally. In the UK, approximately 30-40 children are diagnosed with this condition each year.

Aplastic anaemia can be either inherited or acquired, with the latter being more prevalent. The most common inherited cause is Fanconi’s anaemia. Among patients with acquired aplastic anaemia:

- 80% have an unknown cause (idiopathic)
- 9% develop aplastic anaemia following hepatitis A, B, or C
- 7% develop it after a viral infection such as CMV, EBV, or parvovirus
- 4% acquire it due to medications or other chemicals

Exposure to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and certain medications like chloramphenicol, carbamazepine, phenytoin, mesalazine, and NSAIDs can increase the risk of developing aplastic anaemia. Without timely treatment, this condition can be life-threatening.

## Diagnosis

Children with aplastic anaemia often exhibit bruising or skin changes, such as purpura, due to decreased platelet production. Mucosal bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, fatigue, and general malaise are other common symptoms. Neutropenia, a condition characterized by low neutrophil levels, may lead to frequent infections or fevers, which tend to take longer to resolve.

## Investigations

If aplastic anaemia is suspected, a full blood count should be performed to look for pancytopenia. This would show reduced red cells, reticulocytes, white cells (particularly neutrophils), and platelets. The anaemia is typically microcytic, but may occasionally be macrocytic. 

After the initial blood test, a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy are required. The bone marrow of a child with aplastic anaemia is usually described as hypocellular, with fat cells and other substances filling the space where cells would typically be. 

The severity of aplastic anaemia is determined from the bone marrow biopsy results, as shown in the table below:

| Bone marrow cell levels | Moderate | Severe | Very severe |
|---|---|---|---|
| Neutrophils (x109/L) | `<1.5` | `<0.5` | `<0.2` |
| Platelets (x109/L) | `<100` | `<20` | `<20` |
| Bone marrow cellularity (%) | `<50` | `<30` | `<30` |

In certain cases, genetic testing may be conducted to rule out other conditions like paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and to identify any signs of inherited aplastic anaemia.

## Management (Prescribing)

The treatment of aplastic anaemia has two primary objectives:

1. Alleviate any symptoms experienced by the child, such as symptoms of anaemia and bleeding/bruising. This can be done using red cell or platelet transfusions as required.
2. Address the root cause of aplastic anaemia. 

First-line treatment options will be discussed in the non-prescribing section below. Second-line treatment involves anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), followed by cyclosporin.

Families of children with aplastic anaemia should be made aware of the risks associated with pancytopenia. As these children are at a higher risk of infection, medical help should be sought immediately if the child appears unwell or has a fever. Early antibiotic treatment is common if an infection is suspected.

If first- and second-line treatments fail, the prognosis is poor. A new drug, eltrombopag, designed for people with low platelet counts, has shown promise in increasing levels of all three cells in pancytopenia. However, clinical trials for the use of eltrombopag in aplastic anaemia are yet to begin.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

If there's an identifiable cause for a child’s aplastic anaemia, this should be addressed before commencing curative treatment. For instance, if the cause is due to medications, these should be discontinued, or if the cause is viral, appropriate treatment should be sought.

The first-line treatment for aplastic anaemia is a bone marrow transplant. There is a 25% chance of a sibling’s bone marrow being a match for the patient. If no sibling match is available, the child will be added to the bone marrow transplant list for an unrelated donor. 

Children with aplastic anaemia will usually be fitted with a long-term venous access line, as their treatment is likely to be over an extended period of time.

The prognosis for children with aplastic anaemia is quite variable. Some cases resolve without medical intervention, but this is uncommon. The best chance for a cure is a bone marrow transplant. If both this and drug treatment are unsuccessful, then the prognosis is poor. Untreated aplastic anaemia can progress into leukaemia or paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.
