# Understanding and Managing Croup in Children

## Introduction

Croup is a respiratory ailment typically instigated by a viral infection. It principally targets children between 6 months and 6 years of age. Also referred to as laryngotracheobronchitis, the condition leads to inflammation in the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. The prevalent causes of croup include:

- Parainfluenza virus
- Respiratory syncytial virus
- Influenza virus

The condition known as spasmodic or recurrent croup is characterized by upper airway inflammation and cough without additional symptoms. Nevertheless, viral croup remains the most frequently seen manifestation.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of viral croup is made clinically, based on a combination of indicative signs and symptoms. Croup often manifests as a common cold, with symptoms like sore throat, hoarse voice, and runny nose. In younger children, a distinctive barking cough is prominent, whereas a hoarse voice is more noticeable in older children. The barking cough typically lasts for three days.

**Note:** Fever, if present, is usually less than 38.5˚C. This factor can be useful for distinguishing croup from acute epiglottitis, which is often accompanied by higher temperatures.

The presence of stridor, particularly during inspiration, can help determine the severity of croup. Children with croup may also exhibit stridor, particularly on inspiration, which can help determine the severity of the condition. It's crucial to keep the child calm to avoid escalating the inflammation and airway obstruction. 

Croup is typically mild and non-life-threatening, but in severe cases, it can lead to airway obstruction and, if untreated, can be fatal. As the condition worsens, the affected child may become drowsy, exhibiting noticeable work of breathing through an intercostal recession.

Croup can be classified as:

1. **Mild** – barking cough, no stridor, recession or lethargy
2. **Moderate** – barking cough, stridor and recession at rest, no lethargy
3. **Severe** – barking cough, stridor, recession, agitation and/or lethargy
4. **Impending respiratory failure** – 
   - Same as above plus stridor, chest wall and abdominal breathing out of sync, fatigue in the child
   - Hypoxic and hypercapnic
   - As failure worsens, the work of breathing may decrease

## Clinical Examination

On examination, a child with severe croup may appear agitated. Breath sounds may be quiet or non-existent on chest auscultation, and the child may appear pale and cyanosed. Drowsiness may worsen as the croup progresses. Observations may reveal:

- High initial respiratory rate, which lowers with respiratory failure
- Low oxygen saturations
- High heart rate, particularly due to fever
- High temperature, usually lower than 38.5˚C

## Investigations

Further investigations are generally not required for croup, as it is a clinical diagnosis. Regular observations should be taken, with monitoring of work of breathing to check for deterioration. Chest x-rays are not recommended as they may agitate the child and therefore worsen the condition. However, if an x-ray is done during croup, a narrowed trachea may be noted, called the Steeple sign, although this is not always present.

## Management (Prescribing)

There is currently no specific treatment for the viruses that cause croup. The mainstay of treatment is supportive, aiming to reduce the obstruction and inflammation in the airway. 

### Mild Croup

Should it be necessary, steroids can be administered to stabilize the child and hopefully shorten the duration of the condition, alongside reducing the likelihood of needing intubation should croup become severe. Steroids can be given in several forms:

1. Prednisolone – 2mg/kg orally for 3 days
2. Dexamethasone – a single dose of 0.15mg/kg orally
3. Budesonide – a single nebulised dose of 2mg

### Moderate Croup

For moderate croup, along with steroids, nebulised adrenaline can be administered. A dose of 5ml of 1 in 1000 adrenaline is indicated and should start to relieve symptoms within 30 minutes of administration.

### Severe Croup

Steroids and nebulised adrenaline are also indicated for severe croup. Children in this category will also likely need oxygen, and eventually, if respiratory failure is present, intubation will be required.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Mild croup usually doesn't require hospital admission and can be managed at home. Parents should be advised to keep their child hydrated, calm, and to look for signs of worsening croup. Extra care should be given to any child under one year with croup as the potential to deteriorate is greater. Parents may be advised to try using steam to reduce the child's symptoms. 

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
**Tip:** Anecdotally, steam has been thought to help even though there is no scientific proof.

About 10% of children with croup will need hospital support, although most will be discharged soon after. Children with underlying respiratory conditions, those who have been previously intubated or have had severe croup before, or those with quickly worsening symptoms, should be monitored in the hospital setting. If symptoms continue for longer than a week, medical input may be required. For children who are admitted to the hospital, they should be monitored for at least 3 hours after treatment is given and should have a follow-up, either in the emergency department or in the community over the next day or so.

    question: "A 2-year-old boy presents with a harsh, barking cough and a hoarse voice. His mother reports that his symptoms began after a mild cold. On examination, the child is calm and alert, with no signs of respiratory distress, and his temperature is 37.8˚C. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    correctFeedback: "Correct! The barking cough and hoarse voice, along with the history of a recent cold, are typical features of croup. The absence of high fever and respiratory distress indicates a mild form of the disease.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the child's symptoms and the characteristic features of different respiratory conditions. Which diagnosis is most consistent with a barking cough and a hoarse voice following a cold?"
