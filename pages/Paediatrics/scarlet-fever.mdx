# Scarlet Fever: A Comprehensive Overview

Scarlet fever, a bacterial infection primarily affecting children, is caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_, a group A strep bacterium. It is characterized by symptoms such as tonsillitis, fever, headache, and a distinct maculopapular rash. While most cases are mild, antibiotic treatment is necessary to prevent potential severe complications.

## Etiology and Transmission

Scarlet fever is triggered by the group A strep bacterium, _Streptococcus pyogenes_. This bacterial infection is most prevalent in children aged between 4 and 8 years. The disease is transmitted through:

- Airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing
- Direct or indirect contact with a streptococcal skin infection
- Asymptomatic carriers

## Clinical Presentation

Patients diagnosed with Scarlet fever typically present the following symptoms:

- Initial symptoms: fever, sore throat, swollen neck nodes, headache, nausea, vomiting, and a strawberry-red tongue.
- A maculopapular rash appears 1-2 days following the initial symptoms which:
  - Progresses to become widespread
  - Spares the palms, soles, and a ring around the mouth
  - Has a ‘sandpaper-like’ texture
  - Fades after about a week, following which the affected skin begins to desquamate or shed

## Diagnostic Investigations

Confirming a diagnosis of Scarlet fever involves the following investigations:

- Throat swab for culture or rapid streptococcal antigen testing
- Anti-streptolysin O titre test, which measures the concentration of antibodies against streptolysin O, an exotoxin produced by group A streptococci, indicating current or past exposure

## Management 

### Prescribing Management

Upon suspecting a Scarlet fever diagnosis, initiate antibiotic therapy immediately. The standard empirical therapy includes:

- A 10-day course of oral Penicillin V
- If the patient is allergic to Penicillin, Erythromycin or Clindamycin may be prescribed
- Paracetamol for managing fever and pain

### Non-prescribing Management

While most cases of Scarlet fever are mild and show improvement within 12-24 hours of commencing antibiotics, untreated cases can lead to complications such as:

- Otitis media
- Rheumatic fever
- Pneumonia
- Glomerulonephritis

**Warning:** It's essential to isolate infected children from other household members, if possible. They may return to school after 24 hours of antibiotics, provided their infection is improving.

<summary>Public Health Guidelines</summary>

Scarlet fever is a notifiable disease in England and Wales. Doctors and other healthcare professionals are required by law to report suspected cases to their local health protection teams.
