# Understanding Haemophilia

Haemophilia is a blood clotting disorder characterized by excessive and uncontrolled bleeding following any body injury. This bleeding can be spontaneous or as a result of:

- Mild injuries
- Trauma
- Surgery
- Dental treatments

In rare cases, Haemophilia can be acquired; however, it's usually inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, affecting males almost exclusively. Patients with Haemophilia have a coagulation factor deficiency, due to either a protein defect or a lack of the factor itself.

## Types of Haemophilia

Haemophilia occurs in two main types: A and B, caused by deficiencies in factor VIII and IX, respectively.

- **Haemophilia A:** 
  - Caused by mutations in the F8 gene, leading to a factor VIII deficiency.
  - This is the most common type, affecting up to 1 in 5000 males worldwide.

- **Haemophilia B:** 
  - Caused by mutations in the F9 gene, resulting in a factor IX deficiency.
  - Affects 1 in 20,000 males worldwide.
  - A subtype, Haemophilia B Leyden, leads to excessive bleeding in children, which decreases after puberty.

## Diagnosis of Haemophilia

Diagnosis of Haemophilia is based on a history of recurrent or severe bleeding, either spontaneous or injury-induced. Severe haemophilia is typically diagnosed within the first year of life, while mild or moderate forms may not be diagnosed until adulthood.

### Symptoms in Neonates

Severe haemophilia in newborns may present with:

- Prolonged bleeding following the heel prick test or circumcision 
- Intracranial haemorrhage, affecting 3-5% of neonates, with symptoms like:
  - Hypoactivity
  - Irritability
  - Bulging or tense fontanelle
  - Seizures
  - Pallor
  - Decreased oral intake 

Musculoskeletal bleeding is the most common sign of Haemophilia, manifesting as:

- Pain
- Swelling
- Reduced range of movement of the affected limb or joint
- Erythema
- Calor

Recurrent haemarthrosis can lead to chronic joint damage. Patients may also experience mucocutaneous bleeding (epistaxis and petechiae) and intracranial bleeding. Significant bleeding can lead to fatigue due to iron deficiency anaemia. Female carriers of Haemophilia may exhibit menorrhagia and bleeding following surgery or labour.

## Investigating Haemophilia

Prenatal screening for Haemophilia is possible if the mother is a known carrier, through chorionic villus sampling between 9 and 11 weeks or foetal blood sampling from 18 weeks.

Screening blood tests include:

- **Complete blood count:** Normal in Haemophilia. Haemoglobin and red blood cell count may be low following a significant bleed.
- **Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT):** Measures the ability of clotting factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII to form clots. This will be prolonged in patients with haemophilia.
- **Prothrombin time (PT):** Measures the ability of clotting factors I, II, V, VII, and X to form clots. This will be normal in patients with haemophilia.
- **Fibrinogen:** Helps platelets stick together. This will be normal in patients with haemophilia.

Haemophilia A and B are graded as mild, moderate or severe based on the level of coagulation factor VIII or IX in the blood, respectively.

## Management of Haemophilia

### Prescribing Treatment

Haemophilia treatment involves replacing the deficient coagulation factor through preventative or on-demand treatment.

- **Preventative treatment:** Regular injections, usually administered via an implantable port under the skin. This is a lifelong treatment requiring regular monitoring.
- **On-demand treatment:** Immediate treatment for bleeding, usually reserved for mild or moderate haemophilia.

Regular testing for inhibitors (antibodies to the injected clotting factors) is necessary, as they can reduce the medication's effectiveness. Immune tolerance induction treatment is offered to patients with severe haemophilia A. It is less effective in patients with severe haemophilia B, while those with mild or moderate haemophilia A may be treated with bypassing agents or immunosuppressants.

### Non-prescribing Management

Haemarthrosis can lead to chronic joint damage, necessitating regular monitoring. Surgery to remove damaged synovium and joint replacements may be needed in severe cases.

Physiotherapists can encourage patients to engage in physical activity for fitness and muscle strengthening. Patients on good prophylaxis can participate in high-contact sports, albeit with some risk. Psychosocial support for patients and their families is also beneficial.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with prolonged bleeding following a minor cut. He has a history of recurrent bleeds and easy bruising since childhood. His mother had a similar history. Blood tests show a normal prothrombin time (PT) and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Haemophilia A",
      "Haemophilia B",
      "Von Willebrand disease",
      "Factor V Leiden thrombophilia",
      "Protein C deficiency"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's history of recurrent bleeds, X-linked inheritance pattern, and prolonged APTT with normal PT suggest a deficiency of factor VIII (Haemophilia A) or factor IX (Haemophilia B). The two conditions are clinically indistinguishable and require specific factor assays for differentiation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that Haemophilia A and B are characterized by a prolonged APTT with a normal PT and an X-linked inheritance pattern. Which option best fits this description?"
  },
  {
    question: "A neonate presents with prolonged bleeding following the heel prick test. The child also appears hypoactive and irritable. The mother is known to be a carrier of haemophilia. Which of the following clinical signs is most suggestive of intracranial haemorrhage in this neonate?",
    options: [
      "Pallor",
      "Bulging or tense fontanelle",
      "Epistaxis",
      "Petechiae",
      "Reduced range of movement in a limb"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In neonates with haemophilia, intracranial haemorrhage can present with symptoms like hypoactivity, irritability, bulging or tense fontanelle, seizures, pallor, and decreased oral intake.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the symptoms of intracranial haemorrhage in neonates. Which option is most indicative of increased intracranial pressure?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 32-year-old male with a known history of severe haemophilia A presents with a painful, swollen knee joint following a minor injury. He has experienced similar episodes in the past. Which of the following is the most appropriate management approach?",
