# A Comprehensive Overview of Aortic Stenosis in Children

Aortic Stenosis (AS) is a congenital heart condition characterized by the constriction of the aortic valve, the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta. It stands out as the most prevalent form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOT), with males (at a 3:1 ratio to females) more likely to be affected. While AS can also manifest in adults, usually as a calcification of the valve, in children, it often results from improper formation or thickening of the aortic valve. This leads to diminished flow through the valve and blood accumulation in the left ventricle.

## Understanding Aortic Stenosis

AS in children is typically due to the aortic valve being 'bicuspid,' meaning it comprises two leaflets instead of the usual three. This factor affects roughly 2% of the population, with the majority never experiencing any related issues. A rarer cause is Supravalvular aortic stenosis, which may be associated with Williams syndrome.

Approximately 20% of children diagnosed with AS also have other cardiac abnormalities like coarctation or dilation of the aorta. Some children may also present with a ventral septal defect, ductus arteriosus defect, or other valvular abnormalities. While bicuspid AS is more common, AS can also result from the fusion of leaflets, leading to a single aortic leaflet.

## Diagnosis of Aortic Stenosis

AS often goes unnoticed in children, even in cases of moderate disease, with the age of diagnosis generally depending on the severity of occlusion. Diagnosis is usually incidental during an examination and can be categorized into three groups based on the child's age:

1. Critical AS in neonates
2. AS in infants
3. AS in older children

### Critical AS in Neonates

Critical AS may be suspected if a newborn seems to struggle after birth, presenting with heart failure or even cardiogenic shock soon after birth. Signs of critical AS in neonates include:

- Cyanosis
- Cold peripherals
- Increased peripheral capillary refill time
- Decreased peripheral pulses
- +/- gallop rhythm on heart auscultation (often, no murmur is heard)

### AS in Infants

Approximately 10% of children diagnosed with AS from birth will develop heart failure within their first year of life. In this group, around 60% will start to show signs of their condition within the first couple of months, and the majority will be detected by half a year. Symptoms of severe AS include poor feeding and growth, tachypnoea, a hyperactive precordium, and an ejection systolic murmur. If heart failure is present, the child may also exhibit hepatomegaly and other signs of failure such as oedema.

### AS in Older Children

Older children diagnosed with AS are less likely to display symptoms. Some children may experience fatigue, and rarely, one may collapse or develop chest pain during exercise. This is seen in fewer than 5% of older children with AS. On examination, an ejection systolic murmur may be heard, accompanied by an ejection 'click' at the apex or left sternal edge. Around 30% of children with AS will also have aortic regurgitation, and therefore a diastolic murmur may additionally be heard.

## Investigations

In cases of suspected AS, the primary investigation is an echocardiogram with Doppler to visualize the valve and measure the flow and pressure gradient across the valve. Electrocardiography is not diagnostic for AS, but in older children, signs of left ventricular hypertrophy may be seen, accompanied by inverted T waves. A chest x-ray may be requested and may indicate cardiomegaly or dilation of the aorta.

AS can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe, with symptoms usually presenting once the stenosis has become severe. The term 'critical stenosis' is given when a baby is born with AS requiring urgent attention.

|Severity of AS|Mean Pressure Gradient (mmHg)|Maximum Pressure Gradient (mmHg)|
|---|---|---|
|Mild|`<25`|`<40`|
|Moderate|`25-40`|`40-70`|
|Severe|`>40`|`>70`|

## Management of Aortic Stenosis

### Drug Treatment

Drug treatment is rarely given in AS. The exception to this is in neonates with critical AS, where intravenous prostaglandin E1 can be administered to prevent the ductus arteriosus from closing.

### Non-Drug Management

Definitive treatment of AS involves modifying or replacing the faulty valve, most commonly using balloon valvuloplasty. If AS is detected in the fetus during pregnancy, this procedure can be done between 21-32 weeks gestation to prevent changes to the heart due to poor flow through the left ventricle. This can prevent the development of a complication called hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

Children diagnosed with severe AS should avoid competitive sports due to the risk of syncope and angina leading to sudden death. Also, the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve may have been inherited; therefore, first-degree relatives of a child with AS should be offered echocardiography to rule out the presence of valve changes.
