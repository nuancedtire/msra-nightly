# Intussusception in Children: Causes, Diagnosis, and Management

Intussusception is a common cause of bowel obstruction in children. This medical condition occurs when one part of the intestine slides into another part, similar to the folding parts of a telescope.

## Causes and Location

Typically, intussusception happens at the ileocaecal valve, where the ileum (the last part of the small intestine) telescopes into the colon (the first part of the large intestine). The cause of this invagination can vary. The most frequent cause is an enlarged lymph node, which serves as the 'lead point' for the telescoping. However, it can also be due to pathological conditions such as:

- A malignant tumor
- A polyp
- Other benign masses

**Warning:** If left untreated, intussusception can lead to serious, life-threatening complications, including bowel necrosis and perforation.

## Diagnosis

Intussusception is most common in infants between three and twelve months old, with boys being more affected than girls. The primary symptoms in young children include:

- Intermittent crying and leg flexing due to colicky abdominal pain
- Lethargy in between colic episodes
- Bilious vomiting
- Rectal bleeding, often described as "redcurrant jelly"

During a clinical examination, the following might be observed:

- A sausage-shaped abdominal mass in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, best felt between episodes
- Abdominal distension, if the bowel is obstructed
- Guarding and tenderness, if the bowel is perforated
- Possible hypovolemic shock in severe cases

## Investigations

To confirm a diagnosis of intussusception, the following investigations are typically performed:

- **Ultrasound Scan:** This has the highest sensitivity and specificity for confirming diagnosis.
- **Abdominal X-Ray:** This is done if bowel obstruction or perforation are suspected.
- **Contrast or Gas Enema:** However, be aware that a gas enema carries the risk of bowel perforation.

## Management

The initial goal of management is to stabilize the child, which is achieved by:

- Fluid resuscitation with 20ml/kg IV boluses of normal saline
- Inserting a nasogastric tube
- Administering prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics

All children with suspected intussusception should be referred to a pediatric specialist.

Treatment usually involves a non-surgical approach using an enema, which aims to increase the pressure in the colon and reduce the intussusception. The enema can be air, barium, or saline-based.

If non-surgical approaches are unsuccessful, typically after three attempts, patients may need to undergo surgery and manual reduction of the intussusception. This can be done via laparoscopy or open surgery.
