# Understanding Transposition of The Great Arteries (TGA)

Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) is a congenital heart defect categorized as a cyanotic condition. In the dextro-TGA variant, the heart's left and right outflow tracts are wrongly positioned, causing the aorta to emanate from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. This abnormality can pose a severe threat to life.

## Diagnosis of TGA

Routine screening during pregnancy usually detects most TGA cases. However, TGA can present postnatally, typically after the first 24 hours of life as the ductus arteriosus closes. This closure happens due to the increase in oxygen concentration at birth, which triggers the duct to shut. Once closed, the baby may turn **cyanotic** ('blue baby') and potentially deteriorate rapidly.

Additional signs of TGA include:

- Decreased SpO₂ levels
- A loud, single S2
- A murmur, which only occurs if there is another abnormality like a septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus

## Investigating TGA

The following tests can aid in diagnosing and understanding TGA:

- **Chest X-ray:** The heart may appear normal or exhibit an 'egg on side' appearance. Pulmonary vascular markings are usually increased.
- **ECG:** Typically normal.
- **Echocardiography:** This test identifies the anatomical abnormalities of TGA and can assess for any septal defects and the patency of the ductus arteriosus.
- **Hyperoxia (nitrogen washout) Test:** This test is particularly useful in diagnosing cyanotic heart disease in neonates.

## Managing TGA

The primary goal of initial management is to enhance the mixing between the parallel circulations. This can be achieved by:

- Administering **prostaglandin** infusions to maintain ductal patency
- Conducting a **balloon atrial septostomy** to facilitate intra-atrial mixing

The definitive treatment for TGA is a surgical procedure known as an arterial switch, typically performed within the first few weeks of life. Patients are then kept under observation in congenital heart disease clinics throughout adulthood.

      "Chest X-ray",
      "ECG",
      "Echocardiography",
      "Hyperoxia Test"
