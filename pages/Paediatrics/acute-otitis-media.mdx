# Acute Otitis Media

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a condition characterized by the inflammation of the middle ear, predominantly caused by infection. The primary causative agents are:

- Respiratory viruses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and rhinovirus
- Bacteria such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Moraxella catarrhalis*

AOM most frequently affects children between 6 and 18 months.

## Risk Factors

Several factors increase the risk of developing AOM:

- Craniofacial anomalies, including cleft palate or cleft uvula
- Immunodeficiency
- Attendance at childcare or nursery facilities
- Exposure to unwell siblings
- Lack of breastfeeding
- Supine feeding (feeding while lying down)
- Family history of AOM

## Clinical Presentation

Patients with AOM often exhibit the following symptoms:

- Otalgia (ear pain), typically unilateral
- Reduced hearing or a popping sensation in the affected ear
- Coryza (inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity)
- Fever
- Irritability
- Disturbed sleep
- History of a recent upper respiratory tract infection

During physical examination, the tympanic membrane may appear bulging, red, and opaque. The presence of pus and scarring in the external ear canal (purulent otorrhea) may indicate a perforated tympanic membrane.

## Investigations

The diagnosis of AOM is primarily clinical, and no specific investigations are usually necessary. However, certain tests may be considered if needed:

- Tympanometry or acoustic reflectometry for diagnosing effusion (an accumulation of fluid), although these tests are not typically performed
- Culture of discharge or aspirate obtained through tympanocentesis (removal of fluid from the middle ear)

## Management 

### Prescribing Management 

Analgesia is the first-line treatment for AOM. Regular oral or rectal administration of paracetamol and ibuprofen is recommended.

If symptoms persist after 2-3 days of analgesic treatment, a delayed antibiotic prescription should be considered. The choice of antibiotic should follow local guidelines, although amoxicillin is commonly prescribed.

### Non-prescribing Management

In cases where AOM does not respond to antibiotics or if severe otalgia is present, tympanocentesis may be performed in a secondary care setting. This procedure can provide valuable insights into the causative agent and can also relieve pressure and pain.
