# Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a term used to categorize a collection of conditions characterized by joint inflammation persisting for a minimum of six weeks and onset occurring before the age of 16.

## Diagnosis

Risk factors for JIA involve being female, possessing HLA polymorphisms, and having a family history of autoimmunity.

The signs and symptoms of JIA include:

  * Morning stiffness or stiffness following a period of inactivity that improves after a few hours of movement
  * Swelling in the joints 
  * Limited mobility due to pain or contractures in long-standing untreated disease
  * Limping
  * Enthesitis – swelling and pain at the site of tendon or ligament insertions
  * Fever
  * Salmon-colored rash on the trunk and proximal extremities, with potential for Koebner’s phenomenon (rash upon scratching)
  * Red-eye – potentially signaling uveitis

## Investigations

While JIA is primarily a clinical diagnosis, tests are sometimes conducted to rule out other conditions and categorize the disease. The International League of Association for Rheumatology has classified JIA into seven subtypes as presented in Table 1.

| Subtype | Clinical features | Investigation abnormalities 
| --- | --- | ---  
| Oligoarthritis | Affects 1-4 joints Stiffness and reduced range of motion with minimal pain | ANA positive  
| Polyarthritis (Rheumatoid factor negative) | Affects ≥5 joints Symmetrical with large and small joints affected Stiffness and pain with minimal swelling  | RF negative May have mild anaemia, mild thrombocytosis, mildly elevated ESR and CRP  
| Polyarthritis (Rheumatoid factor positive) | Affects ≥5 joints Symmetrical with large and small joints affected Stiffness and pain with minimal swelling | RF positive May have mild anaemia, mild thrombocytosis, mildly elevated ESR and CRP  
| Systemic arthritis | Oligoarthritis or polyarthritis with spiking fevers for at least 2 weeks Rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, serositis | Anaemia, leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) 
| Psoriatic arthritis | Asymmetrical arthritis  Psoriatic skin lesions Dactylitis and nail pitting | None  
| Enthesitis-related arthritis | Large joint lower limb and spine arthritis and enthesitis followed by sacroiliac and lumbar involvement Anterior uveitis  | HLA-B27 positive  
| Undifferentiated arthritis | JIA that does not meet criteria for other forms | None  

## Prescribing Management

Conservative measures are the first line of treatment for JIA. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be prescribed for pain relief, though they do not contribute to disease modification.

In cases where conservative measures are insufficient, disease-modifying agents like methotrexate or sulfasalazine can be utilized. Monitoring of liver function is necessary with methotrexate, and full blood count (FBC) and metabolic panel monitoring with sulfasalazine. Complementary treatments include:

  * Corticosteroids – Oral or intra-articular therapy allows time for other disease-modifying agents to take effect. Long term use should be avoided.
  * Folic acid – To decrease side effects of nausea, oral ulcers and abnormal liver enzymes
  * Antiemetics – To relieve side effects of nausea
  * NSAIDs – For pain relief
  * Continuing physiotherapy and occupational therapies

For third line options, TNF-alpha inhibitors and biologics are considered.

## Non-Prescribing Management

Management of JIA patients should be handled by a multidisciplinary team. Patients should be encouraged to:

  * Engage in regular exercise as inactivity can lead to deconditioning and increased disability 
  * Use heat packs to relieve pain and stiffness 
  * Consider foot orthoses to potentially reduce pain and improve quality of life

  {
    question: "A 7-year-old girl presents to the pediatrician with complaints of morning stiffness and limited mobility in her left knee for the past 8 weeks. Her mother reports that her symptoms seem to improve after a few hours of movement. Physical examination reveals swelling in the left knee joint. Which subtype of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is most likely in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Oligoarthritis",
      "Polyarthritis (Rheumatoid factor negative)",
      "Polyarthritis (Rheumatoid factor positive)",
      "Systemic arthritis",
      "Psoriatic arthritis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's symptoms of morning stiffness, limited mobility, and swelling in less than five joints suggest a diagnosis of the oligoarthritis subtype of JIA.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the number of joints affected and the characteristics of the patient's symptoms. Which JIA subtype aligns most closely with these findings?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 13-year-old boy has been diagnosed with a subtype of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) that includes enthesitis and arthritis of the spine. He also tested positive for HLA-B27. Which subtype of JIA does he likely have?",
    options: [
      "Oligoarthritis",
      "Polyarthritis (Rheumatoid factor negative)",
      "Polyarthritis (Rheumatoid factor positive)",
      "Systemic arthritis",
      "Enthesitis-related arthritis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of enthesitis, spine arthritis, and a positive HLA-B27 test suggest a diagnosis of the enthesitis-related arthritis subtype of JIA.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's clinical features and the results of his HLA-B27 test. Which JIA subtype is most consistent with these findings?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 10-year-old girl has been diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). She has been experiencing severe pain and the conservative measures have proven ineffective. Which of the following would be an appropriate next step in her treatment?",
    options: [
      "Prescribe a regimen of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) only",
      "Begin disease-modifying agents such as methotrexate or sulfasalazine",
      "Start her on TNF-alpha inhibitors and biologics immediately",
      "Recommend heat packs only",
      "Suggest a regimen of regular exercise only"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! If conservative measures are insufficient, disease-modifying agents like methotrexate or sulfasalazine can be used for patients with JIA. These drugs help in slowing the progression of the disease and reducing the severity of symptoms.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the severity of the patient's symptoms and the ineffectiveness of conservative measures. What would be the appropriate next line of treatment in this case?"
