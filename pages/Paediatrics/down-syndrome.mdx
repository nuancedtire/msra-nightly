# Understanding Down Syndrome

Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder contributing to intellectual disability and characteristic physical features. It is triggered by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Three types of Down Syndrome exist:

- **Trisomy 21:** An additional chromosome 21 is present in all cells due to nondisjunction during cell division in egg or sperm formation. This type is the most prevalent.
- **Mosaic Down Syndrome:** An extra chromosome 21 exists in some cells only, resulting from an error in cell division after the fertilization of the egg.
- **Translocation Down Syndrome:** The additional chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome. A parent may have a balanced translocation and not exhibit any symptoms but can pass an unbalanced translocation to their child, leading to Down Syndrome.

## Diagnosis

Down Syndrome leads to mild to moderate intellectual disability. Children affected by it tend to have developmental delays and behavioral problems. They generally require varying degrees of support throughout their lives.

People with Down Syndrome exhibit certain characteristic features including:

- Low-set ears
- Small head, ears, and mouth
- Short neck
- Almond-shaped eyes
- Flattened nasal bridge
- Single palmar crease
- Short stature
- Hypotonia (low muscle tone)

Children with Down Syndrome are more prone to certain conditions such as:

- Congenital heart disease
- Vision problems
- Recurrent ear infections leading to hearing problems
- Hypothyroidism
- Blood disorders
- Gastrointestinal conditions
- Mental health problems
- Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (typically from the age of 50)

## Investigations

### Combined Test

This test uses maternal age, blood test information, and an ultrasound scan to screen for Down Syndrome, Edwards’ Syndrome, and Patau’s Syndrome between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. The ultrasound measures the 'nuchal translucency,' the fluid thickness at the back of the baby's neck. An increased nuchal translucency raises suspicion of fetal abnormality.

### Quadruple Test

If it's impossible to measure the nuchal translucency due to the baby's position, a quadruple blood screening test can be carried out between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. This test screens solely for Down Syndrome.

### Diagnostic Tests

If screening tests suggest Down Syndrome, mothers are offered a diagnostic test, which carries up to a 1% risk of miscarriage.

- **Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS):** Performed between 11 and 14 weeks, this test involves aspirating cells from the placenta to test for Down Syndrome.
- **Amniocentesis:** Conducted from week 15, this test involves aspirating a sample of amniotic fluid and testing cells for Down Syndrome.

### Postnatal Diagnosis

If the diagnosis remains uncertain, a karyotype test can be performed.

## Management

There is no cure for Down Syndrome. Management focuses on helping children enhance their physical and intellectual abilities and treating any associated conditions.

Patients with Down Syndrome may need assistance from various healthcare professionals, including:

- Physiotherapists
- Speech and language therapists
- Occupational therapists
- Pediatric specialists (cardiologists, ophthalmologists, audiologists, etc.) if they develop associated conditions
- Psychological support
- Educational support

Parents may also require genetic counseling and support.

    question: "Parents bring their 2-year-old child for evaluation due to concerns about delayed development. They mention that he was diagnosed with Down Syndrome at birth. On physical examination, he has low-set ears, a small head, a short neck, and almond-shaped eyes. Which of the following conditions is he most likely to develop?",

    incorrectFeedback: "Incorrect. Consider the most common conditions associated with Down Syndrome. Which one is most likely to occur in these patients?"
  },
  {
    question: "A couple have a child diagnosed with Down Syndrome. They are planning to have another child and are concerned about the risk of recurrence. The mother's karyotype reveals a balanced translocation involving chromosome 21. Which type of Down Syndrome does their affected child most likely have?",
    options: [
      "Trisomy 21",
      "Mosaic Down Syndrome",
      "Translocation Down Syndrome",
      "None of the above",
      "All of the above"
