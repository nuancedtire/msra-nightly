# Hirschsprung’s Disease: An Overview

Hirschsprung’s disease is a rare, congenital disorder that affects the bowel. The disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion nerve cells in a portion of the bowel, which hinders peristalsis and leads to stool blockages. Most commonly, nerve cells are missing in the rectum and sigmoid colon, but the entire colon and part of the small intestine can also be affected.

## Prevalence

The disease predominantly affects males, who are four times more likely to develop the condition than females.

## Symptoms

Hirschsprung’s disease symptoms vary based on the age of the patient.

### Symptoms in Neonates

- Failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours after birth
- Abdominal distension
- Bilious vomiting

### Symptoms in Infants and Children

- Abdominal pain
- Persistent constipation
- Failure to thrive

## Associated Conditions

Up to 40% of patients with Hirschsprung Disease may develop Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis. This is an inflammation of the small intestines and colon, which can lead to sepsis or toxic megacolon if not treated or if severe. Symptoms include:

- Fever
- Explosive diarrhoea
- Abdominal swelling
- Fatigue 
- Vomiting 
- Rectal bleeding

## Diagnosis

Most diagnoses are made within the first year of life. However, a diagnosis should also be considered in individuals with a history of severe constipation that does not respond to oral medication. 

### Diagnostic Investigations

- `Abdominal x-ray:` This is done to exclude bowel obstruction. 
- `Contrast enema:` It reveals a transition zone between the aganglionic portion of bowel and the functional bowel. 
- `Anorectal manometry:` This assesses the function of the anal sphincter muscles.
- `Rectal biopsy:` This definitive diagnostic test for Hirschsprung’s disease reveals an absence of ganglion cells in the affected tissue when viewed under a microscope.

## Management

### Prescribing Management

Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis requires treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anal irrigation, and aggressive IV rehydration. Anal irrigation, which involves washing the bowel with warm water to soften the faeces for excretion, is a temporary measure before surgery.

### Non-Prescribing Management

The definitive treatment for Hirschsprung Disease is surgery to remove the section of the bowel lacking the ganglion cells. This can be performed in one or multiple operations, depending on the child's health.

If Hirschsprung’s disease is suspected to be a part of a broader genetic condition such as Down Syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIA, the child should be referred to a clinical geneticist.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 3-day-old neonate has failed to pass meconium since birth and has developed abdominal distension. Which of the following is the most definitive diagnostic test for Hirschsprung’s disease in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Abdominal x-ray",
      "Contrast enema",
      "Anorectal manometry",
      "Rectal biopsy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Rectal biopsy is the most definitive diagnostic test for Hirschsprung’s disease. It reveals an absence of ganglion cells in the affected tissue when viewed under a microscope.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember, while other tests can be useful in the diagnostic process, the most definitive diagnostic test for Hirschsprung’s disease is the one that reveals an absence of ganglion cells in the affected tissue."

    question: "A 6-month-old infant with a history of persistent constipation is diagnosed with Hirschsprung’s disease. Which of the following is the definitive treatment for this condition?",
    options: [
      "Anal irrigation",
      "Broad-spectrum antibiotics",
      "Surgical removal of the affected bowel section",
      "Aggressive IV rehydration"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The definitive treatment for Hirschsprung Disease is surgery to remove the section of the bowel lacking the ganglion cells. Other treatment measures like anal irrigation and IV rehydration are temporary and primarily used to manage associated conditions like Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the primary pathophysiology of Hirschsprung's disease: the absence of ganglion cells in a portion of the bowel. What treatment would directly address this issue?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 4-year-old child with Hirschsprung’s disease develops fever, explosive diarrhoea, and abdominal swelling. Which of the following conditions is most likely causing these symptoms?",
    options: [
      "Toxic megacolon",
      "Sepsis",
      "Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis",
      "Bowel obstruction"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The symptoms described are indicative of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis, an inflammation of the small intestines and colon that can occur in patients with Hirschsprung Disease. If not treated or if severe, it can lead to sepsis or toxic megacolon.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the common complications associated with Hirschsprung's Disease. Which condition would likely cause symptoms such as fever, explosive diarrhoea, and abdominal swelling?"
