# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) - A Comprehensive Overview 

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation of immature lymphocytes. This article provides a detailed overview of ALL, including its types, risk factors, symptoms, diagnostic tests, and management strategies.

## Introduction

ALL is the most common type of leukaemia in children, with two main subtypes:

- B Cell Lineage (B-ALL)
- T Cell Lineage (T-ALL)

**B-ALL** peaks between the ages of 2 and 4, while **T-ALL**, though rare, is most prevalent in teenagers.

## Risk Factors for ALL

Certain factors can increase the risk of developing ALL. These include:

- Being under 6 years of age
- Having genetic disorders such as Down syndrome or Klinefelterâ€™s syndrome
- Exposure to radiation
- Having a preceding viral illness

## Symptoms of ALL

The onset of ALL symptoms usually spans over several weeks. These symptoms arise from:

- **Bone Marrow Failure:**
  - Anaemia symptoms such as pallor, fatigue, dyspneoa, and dizziness
  - Neutropenia symptoms such as recurrent infections (fever)
  - Thrombocytopenia symptoms such as petechial rash, bruising (ecchymoses), and bleeding (e.g., epistaxis)
- **Lymphoblast Infiltration:**
  - Painless enlarged lymph nodes
  - Abdominal mass due to rapid proliferation in B-ALL
  - Hepatosplenomegaly and abdominal pain
  - Bone pain due to bone marrow involvement
  - Renal enlargement 
  - Painless unilateral testicular enlargement 
  - CNS involvement leading to focal neurology (including cranial nerve palsies), papilledema, meningism
  - Mediastinal mass causing stridor, wheeze, pericardial effusion and superior vena cava syndrome (seen in T-ALL)
- **Constitutional "B" symptoms** such as weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, anorexia 

## Diagnostic Investigations for ALL

Several tests can help diagnose ALL:

- **Blood Tests:**
  - Full Blood Count (FBC) revealing normocytic normochromic anaemia (low Hb, normal MCV, normal MHC), low reticulocyte count, leucocytosis (high white cell count), neutropenia (low neutrophils), thrombocytopaenia (low platelets)
  - Blood film showing presence of blast cells
- **Special Tests:**
  - Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy 
    - Cytology: Diagnosis is confirmed when at least `20%` lymphoblasts are present in the bone marrow 
    - Immunophenotyping to identify cell surface markers. In ALL, the patient is usually MPO negative and Tdt positive 
    - Molecular studies to detect chromosomal rearrangements 
- **Other Tests:**
  - Baseline blood tests such as U&E, other serum electrolytes (calcium, phosphorous, uric acid), clotting studies (risk of DIC), LFT (liver failure if infiltration), LDH (elevated due to cell destruction, suggests a bad prognosis)
  - Chest X-ray to detect mediastinal mass, pleural effusion or lower respiratory tract infection
  - CT/MRI to visualize mediastinal mass or CNS infiltration 
  - Blood culture in case of signs of infection
  - Lumbar puncture in case of signs of infection or if CNS involvement is suspected (presence of leukaemia blast cells) 

## Management of ALL

The management of ALL involves both prescribing and non-prescribing strategies.

### Prescribing Management

Chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for ALL. In certain cases, targeted therapies and immunotherapies may also be considered.

In persistent disease, the prescription of prophylactic antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals) is crucial due to the patient's heightened infection risk. Prophylactic rasburicase and allopurinol are also prescribed to prevent tumour lysis syndrome, a metabolic complication of chemotherapy-induced tumour cell death.

### Non-Prescribing Management

Non-prescribing management includes supportive treatments that alleviate symptoms, such as platelet and red cell transfusions. Bone marrow transplants in children have proven highly effective, inducing remission in `80-90%` of cases.
