# Understanding Meckel’s Diverticulum: Diagnosis, Investigation, and Management

Meckel’s Diverticulum (MD) is the most prevalent congenital abnormality of the small intestine, found in 1% to 3% of the population. It forms due to the failure of the vitelline duct to regress during fetal development.

## Diagnosis

Although MD is typically asymptomatic, it can result in complications such as bleeding, obstruction, inflammation, or perforation. In children, symptomatic MD usually surfaces before the age of 2. The symptoms for each complication are:

- **Bleeding:** Characterized by acute, episodic, painless bleeding. Patients may become tachycardic and hypotensive.
- **Small Bowel Obstruction:** Symptoms include intractable constipation, crampy abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. In cases of intussusception causing the obstruction, a palpable abdominal mass and “redcurrant jelly” stools may be observed.
- **Inflammation:** Meckel’s diverticulitis, although rare in children, can present with periumbilical pain that shifts to the right lower quadrant, imitating appendicitis. Diagnosis is typically made during perioperative imaging or surgery.
- **Perforation:** Symptoms include sudden, diffuse, severe abdominal pain, exacerbated with movement and rebound tenderness, guarding and rigidity, nausea and vomiting, fever, and abdominal distention. Both Meckel’s diverticulitis and small bowel obstruction with MD can cause perforation.

## Investigation

The investigation approach depends on the specific complication:

- **Bleeding:**
  - Full Blood Count (FBC): Decreased Hemoglobin (Hb), decreased haematocrit, leucocytosis.
  - Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan ('Meckel's scan'): Performed if the patient is haemodynamically stable, to diagnose MD.
  - Contrast Enema: This is both diagnostic and therapeutic if intussusception is suspected.
  - Surgical Abdominal Exploration: May be needed if the diagnosis remains unclear.
- **Obstruction:**
  - Plain Abdominal X-ray: Shows dilated bowel loops, air-fluid level, no gas distal to the obstruction.
  - CT Scan: To diagnose MD as the cause of obstruction.
- **Inflammation and Perforation:**
  - CT Scan: To image inflamed MD.
  - Surgical Exploration: Imaging should not delay surgery, especially if perforation is suspected.

## Management

The management method is again dependent on the specific complication:

- **Prescribing Management:** In cases of perforation or peritonitis, antibiotics are given as an adjunct to surgery. The choice of antibiotic is guided by local guidelines, with common choices being cefotaxime, clindamycin, and/or metronidazole.
- **Non-prescribing Management:** If MD is found incidentally on imaging and the patient is asymptomatic, no treatment is needed. However, if MD is found during surgery, it should be removed in children and young adults.

The definitive treatment of symptomatic MD is excision of the diverticulum. Additional management methods based on the complication are:

- **Bleeding:** The opposing region of the ileum is also removed as it is often the source of bleeding.
- **Obstruction:** Any adhesions are also removed.
- **Perforation or Peritonitis:** A small bowel resection may be necessary if there is extensive pathology.

    correctFeedback: "Correct! The described symptoms suggest a small bowel obstruction possibly due to intussusception caused by Meckel's Diverticulum. The initial investigation should be a plain abdominal X-ray.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the symptoms and signs described. What condition do they suggest, and what would be the appropriate initial investigation?"
