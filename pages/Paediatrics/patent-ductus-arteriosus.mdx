# Patent Ductus Arteriosus: Diagnosis and Management

Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) is a medical condition characterized by the persistence of the ductus arteriosus — a fetal circulation shunt between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk — after one month beyond the expected delivery date.

## Risk Factors

PDA is associated with several risk factors:

- Prematurity
- Maternal rubella infection during the first trimester
- Female gender

## Signs and Symptoms

The signs and symptoms of PDA can vary largely based on the size of the shunt and the age of the patient. Premature babies with larger shunts are likely to display more severe clinical features. These can include:

- Asymptomatic presentation
- A continuous 'machine-like' murmur, which is initially only audible in systole but may extend into diastole as the newborn ages. This murmur is typically located in the left infraclavicular region and can radiate to the back. It may be associated with:
  - Wide pulse pressure
  - Bounding pulse
  - Heaving apex beat
- Signs and symptoms of heart failure, such as:
  - Failure to thrive
  - Apnea, particularly in premature babies
  - Tachycardia
  - Difficulty breathing and sweating during feeding, leading to poor feeding
  - Exercise intolerance in older children with small shunts
  - Hepatosplenomegaly
- In cases where PDA presents late, signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension may occur, such as tachypnea with increasing respiratory distress (which may necessitate mechanical ventilation).

## Investigations

To diagnose PDA, the following investigations are typically performed:

- Chest X-ray: This may show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings.
- Echocardiogram: This is the definitive test for PDA, showing the presence of a shunt. Doppler can be used to characterize the blood flow within the shunt.

## Management

### Prescribing Management

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as indomethacin or ibuprofen can be used in the management of PDA. These drugs are cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors that inhibit prostaglandins and can initiate duct closure in some patients.

For premature infants less than 32 weeks old, intravenous indomethacin or ibuprofen is the first-line therapy. Prophylactic indomethacin may be administered in the first 12 hours of birth to premature infants with very low birth weights (cut-off rates vary between `<1300g – <1000g`), even before PDA is evident.

### Non-Prescribing Management

In term infants, children, and adults, the first-line management is percutaneous catheter device closure. If the duct is too large, fails to close with medical therapy, or the child is too small, surgical ligation is recommended.
