# Understanding Tetralogy of Fallot

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, affecting approximately one in 2,000-3,500 newborns. It is characterized by four major abnormalities, which are a consequence of a single developmental anomaly - the anterior malalignment of the conal septum. This septum separates the aortic and pulmonary outlets. Despite its multifactorial etiology, approximately 25% of TOF patients have chromosomal abnormalities, with trisomy 21 and 22q11.2 microdeletions, such as DiGeorge syndrome, being the most common.

## Key Anatomical Abnormalities

TOF is characterized by four major anatomical abnormalities:

![Major abnormalities in Tetralogy of Fallot](https://medibuddy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tetralogy-of-Fallot-–-Overall-Explanation.png)

1. **Pulmonary stenosis**, which can range from mild stenosis to atresia and is also referred to as the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction.
2. An **overriding aorta**.
3. A **ventricular septal defect** (VSD).
4. **Right ventricular hypertrophy**.

## Diagnosis

TOF is generally diagnosed between the age of 1-2 months. It is associated with right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood and subsequent cyanosis. However, the degree of cyanosis varies depending on the severity of pulmonary stenosis and the size of the VSD. In cases of mild stenosis, it may present as an asymptomatic murmur, while severe TOF can cause birth cyanosis and "TET spells" (hypercyanosis). These spells are due to acute and severe right-to-left shunting, leading to profound and potentially dangerous cyanosis.

**Physical signs** include:

- Cyanosis and clubbing
- Ejection systolic murmur, loudest at the upper left sternal border (pulmonary stenosis)
- Single S2
- Parasternal heave (right ventricular hypertrophy)

A diagnosis can be confirmed based on these clinical features and confirmed through echocardiography.

## Investigations

To confirm the diagnosis and plan for the surgical repair, a combination of the following investigations is typically used:

- **Chest X-ray**: Can reveal a normal-sized, boot-shaped heart (_coeur en sabot_), a right-sided aortic arch, and reduced pulmonary vascular markings.
- **ECG**: May show right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy, and a right bundle branch block.
- **Echocardiography**: This is typically sufficient for confirming the diagnosis of TOF and planning surgical repair.
- **Cardiovascular MR and CT**: These may be useful when pulmonary hypertension is suspected.
- **Hyperoxia (nitrogen washout) test**: This is used for diagnosing cyanotic heart disease in neonates.

## Non-Prescribing Management

The mainstay of TOF management is surgical intervention. This generally includes:

- **Anatomical repair**, which aims to close the VSD and relieve the RVOT obstruction. Typically performed in infants between the ages of 3-6 months, this procedure has a favourable long-term survival rate.
- **Palliative shunts**, such as the modified Blalock–Taussig (between the subclavian and pulmonary arteries) or Waterston (ascending aorta to pulmonary artery), may be offered as part of staged procedures for neonates who are very cyanosed.

## Prescribing Management

In terms of pharmacological management:

- **Prostaglandin E1** infusions may be needed in neonates with severe cyanosis to maintain ductal patency.
- **Beta-blockers** can be used during TET spells to minimize RVOT obstruction.
