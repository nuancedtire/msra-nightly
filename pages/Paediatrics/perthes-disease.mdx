# Perthes’ Disease: Diagnosis and Management

Perthes’ disease, also known as Legg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease, is a rare pediatric hip disorder most commonly seen in children aged 4-9 years. This disease is characterized by the avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis and is generally considered idiopathic.

## Epidemiology

Perthes’ disease is more prevalent in boys, with a male-to-female ratio of 5:1. Bilateral involvement occurs in 12% of cases, although symmetrical disease stage is infrequent.

## Clinical Presentation

Children with Perthes’ disease typically present with the following **symptoms** and **signs**:

- **Symptoms:**
  - Insidious onset is the norm.
  - Presentation can include a painless limp, or intermittent hip, groin, and/or knee pain, especially during physical activity.

- **Signs:**
  - Antalgic gait.
  - Loss of internal rotation and abduction at the hip.

## Investigations

**Imaging** plays a pivotal role in diagnosing and determining the severity of Perthes’ disease.

- **X-ray of the pelvis** (AP and ‘frog leg’ lateral views) is used for initial diagnosis and to classify disease severity.
  - Early-stage disease may not have definitive radiographic features.
  - Later stages may show increased density, flattening or fragmenting of the femoral head, and joint space widening.

- **Bone scans** and **MRI scans** are more sensitive than plain radiographs for diagnosing Perthes’ disease. They are employed as second-line investigations following a normal radiograph.

## Management

Children diagnosed with Perthes’ disease should be assessed and managed by pediatric orthopedic surgeons. Despite the fact that most cases are self-limiting and are not associated with long-term complications, all children should be monitored through regular examinations and imaging every few months.

**Note:** Children with more severe Perthes’ disease have an increased risk of developing secondary osteoarthritis in adulthood.

The primary goals of treatment are to prevent deformity and delay the onset of osteoarthritis. Conservative management strategies include rest, exercise restriction, analgesia, physiotherapy, and immobilization. Surgical intervention, such as femoral head ostectomy, may be considered in certain cases.

    question: "A 6-year-old boy presents to the pediatric clinic with a painless limp and intermittent hip pain during physical activity. On examination, the physician notes an antalgic gait and loss of internal rotation and abduction at the hip. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line imaging study for this patient?",
    options: [
      "X-ray of the pelvis",
      "Bone scan",
      "MRI scan",
      "Ultrasound of the hip",
      "CT scan of the pelvis"

    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An X-ray of the pelvis (AP and 'frog leg' lateral views) is the initial imaging modality of choice for a patient suspected of having Perthes' disease. Even though bone scans and MRI scans are more sensitive, they are usually reserved as second-line investigations following a normal radiograph.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that Perthes' disease is a pediatric hip disorder characterized by avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. Which imaging modality would be most suitable for visualizing changes in the bony structures of the hip?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 7-year-old girl previously diagnosed with Perthes' disease presents to the clinic for a routine follow-up visit. She has been receiving conservative management, including rest, exercise restriction, analgesia, physiotherapy, and immobilization. Which of the following is a potential long-term complication she is at increased risk for?",
    options: [
      "Osteomyelitis",
      "Septic arthritis",
      "Osteosarcoma",
      "Secondary osteoarthritis",
      "Rheumatoid arthritis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Children with more severe Perthes' disease have an increased risk of developing secondary osteoarthritis in adulthood. This is due to the potential for deformity following avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the pathophysiology of Perthes' disease, which involves avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. What long-term complication could arise from such damage to the hip joint?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 5-year-old boy with a known history of Perthes' disease presents to the emergency department with worsening hip pain and decreased range of motion in the hip. His condition has not improved with conservative management. Which of the following surgical interventions may be considered in this case?",
    options: [
      "Hip arthroscopy",
      "Total hip replacement",
      "Femoral head ostectomy",
      "Pelvic osteotomy",
      "Hip resurfacing"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In cases of Perthes' disease that do not respond to conservative management, surgical intervention may be considered. Femoral head ostectomy, the surgical removal of the femoral head, is one potential surgical option.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the nature of Perthes' disease and the age of the patient. What surgical procedure would be most appropriate for managing severe cases of this pediatric hip disorder?"
