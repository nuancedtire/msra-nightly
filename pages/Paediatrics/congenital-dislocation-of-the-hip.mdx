# Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)

Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH), previously known as congenital dislocation of the hip, is a musculoskeletal disorder characterized by improper formation of the hip joint during development. This malformation can lead to an unstable joint, which may result in the femur partially or completely moving out of the acetabulum (hip socket). 

## Prevalence and Risk Factors

- DDH affects approximately 2 in 1000 births and requires treatment. However, hip instability in newborns (20 in 1000 births) often resolves within a few weeks post birth.
- Two major factors contribute to DDH: laxity of the hip joint and restrictions in the intrauterine space, such as being the firstborn child, oligohydramnios, or being in the breech position during the last month of pregnancy or at birth.
- Females are five times more likely than males to develop DDH.
- The condition is 1.5 times more likely to affect the left hip than the right, although it can affect both hips in the same individual.
- DDH risk increases if other first-degree relatives have the condition.
- Other associated congenital disorders include torticollis, talipes calcaneovalgus, Down’s syndrome, as well as certain muscular and neurological conditions.

## Diagnosis

Early diagnosis of DDH is essential as treatment outcomes significantly improve with early intervention. If left untreated, children may develop a limp, report hip joint pain, and may develop osteoarthritis prematurely.

### Neonates

In the first 72 hours of life, all neonates undergo a newborn baby check, which includes an examination of both hips. Two tests primarily used to detect hip dislocation are the Ortolani’s and Barlow’s tests. 

- **Ortolani’s Test:** The hip is flexed to 90˚, abducted, pressed anteriorly, and checked for a ‘clunk’ suggesting the dislocated hip has returned to the correct position.
- **Barlow’s Test:** The hip is held at 90˚, adducted, and pressed posteriorly to determine whether the hip will dislocate.

These tests are mainly utilized in the first two months after birth and become less useful as the hip joint muscles develop.

### Infants and Older Children

After three months, the child's hip movement range is tested. Noticeable symptoms at this age could include:

- **Galeazzi Sign:** One leg appears shorter due to dislocation.
- One leg being shorter than the other or different gluteal folds on the left and right side.
- Delayed crawling or walking, or a limp that does not cause discomfort.
- Walking heavily on their toes, referred to as ‘toe walking’.
- Falling more than their peers or failing to lift one leg off the ground when crawling.
- A positive Trendelenburg test where standing on the affected leg with the other leg lifted off the ground leads to tilting towards the lifted leg.

## Investigations

If DDH is suspected during a newborn baby check, an ultrasound of the hips should be requested within two weeks. Newborns with DDH risk factors may require an ultrasound before six weeks of age. After six months, anterior-posterior views of the pelvis via X-ray are recommended.

## Management

Although there is no drug treatment for DDH, early treatment after diagnosis via ultrasound or X-ray should be initiated. The child should be urgently referred to a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon.

### Non-Prescribing Management

If the child is under six months, a Pavlik harness can be fitted. This fabric harness worn around the legs and waist keeps the hips flexed and partially abducted, allowing the hips to develop in a healthy position. If used early in life, it may be the only required treatment for DDH. The harness should be worn all the time for several weeks and should only be removed by healthcare professionals.

If the Pavlik harness is unsuccessful or the child is over six months, surgery may be required. Surgical interventions include closed or open reduction under general anaesthetic, with or without osteotomy for any bony deformities. Post-surgery, the child may need to be in a plaster cast for up to 12 weeks and may require further surgeries in the future. Post-surgery, there is a risk of avascular necrosis of the hip.

Parents should be advised that swimming may be beneficial for hip development and to avoid swaddling the child too tightly due to a small risk of dysplasia.
