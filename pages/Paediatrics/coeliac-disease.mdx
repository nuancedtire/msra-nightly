# Coeliac Disease: An Overview 

Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a lifelong intolerance to gluten, a protein found in barley, wheat, rye, and oats. It affects approximately 1% of the population and has associations with other conditions such as Type 1 diabetes, IgA deficiency, and Down’s Syndrome. It can also run in families.

When a person with Coeliac disease consumes gluten, it results in an enteropathy, leading to various gastrointestinal symptoms. 

## Prevalence and Symptoms 

Coeliac disease has no specific age group for onset and can present during childhood or adulthood. In infants, symptoms can appear as early as when gluten is introduced to the diet. Common symptoms include:

- Chronic diarrhoea
- Pale, floating stools
- Fatigue 
- Poor growth 

In children, failure to thrive often triggers investigation into this condition. Other associated symptoms may include rectal bleeding and vomiting. Dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin condition characterized by itchy, crusted blisters appearing in groups symmetrically across the body, is a less common sign of Coeliac disease. 

Due to increased screening, particularly in those with a family history or conditions making them more susceptible, many cases are detected even before symptoms occur. However, undetected late-stage Coeliac disease can present with:

- Poor growth
- Developmental delay
- Iron deficiency anaemia
- Nutritional deficiencies
- Joint pain 

If left untreated, Coeliac disease can affect nearly all organ systems and, in rare cases, progress to a Coeliac crisis caused by dehydration secondary to chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption due to enteropathy.

## Diagnosis 

The diagnosis of Coeliac disease involves a combination of clinical history, symptom assessment, and specific investigations. The investigations include:

1. Full blood count and blood film – may show microcytic anaemia, suggesting iron deficiency.
2. Serum tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody (TTG) – the first-line specific investigation for Coeliac disease. A high level of TTG is suggestive of Coeliac disease.
3. Endomysial antibody (EMA) – considered second-line to TTG due to its higher cost and lower sensitivity. A high level suggests Coeliac disease.
4. Anti-gliadin antibody – rarely used due to its expense and lower reliability. A positive result suggests Coeliac disease.

If any of these tests suggest Coeliac disease, the patient is referred for an endoscopy. The small intestine may present a scalloped appearance with mucosal fold atrophy. However, a definitive diagnosis requires a biopsy showing distinctive features of Coeliac disease:

1. Villous atrophy
2. Crypt hyperplasia
3. Increased lymphocytes in the epithelium

**Warning:** Patients being tested for Coeliac disease should continue to eat gluten during the testing phase. This is because antibody levels and villi on endoscopy may return to normal without exposure to gluten, leading to false-negative results.

If the diagnosis remains uncertain after testing, a trial of a gluten-free diet may be advised. Resolution of symptoms upon gluten removal serves as the final step in diagnosing Coeliac disease.

## Management 

The management of Coeliac disease primarily involves dietary modifications and supportive medications.

### Prescribing Management

There is no curative drug treatment for Coeliac disease. Medications, such as iron, vitamin D, or calcium supplements, play a supportive role in replacing any nutrients the patient may be deficient in. In the rare event of a Coeliac crisis, fluids, corticosteroids, and electrolyte replacement can be administered to stabilize the patient.

### Non-prescribing Management

The cornerstone of Coeliac disease management is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which should resolve symptoms and return the gut appearance to normal. In the UK, gluten-free alternatives can be prescribed via the NHS to aid families who may not have access to them.

**Warning:** If gluten is reintroduced to the diet, it will trigger villous atrophy again. Uncontrolled Coeliac disease increases the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the small bowel, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, particularly enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. Well-controlled Coeliac disease reduces this risk to levels seen in the general population.
</Callout>

TTG testing can be used to assess adherence to the gluten-free diet in individuals with Coeliac disease. In children, resolution of failure to thrive along with good growth and development suggests successful diet treatment.
