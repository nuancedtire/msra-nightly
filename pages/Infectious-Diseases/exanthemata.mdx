# Understanding Exanthems in Pediatric Patients

Exanthems are widespread rashes that appear suddenly, affecting multiple areas of the skin at the same time. These rashes are more prevalent in children and often accompany symptoms like fever, malaise, and headache. The causes of exanthems can include toxins, drugs, microorganisms (most commonly viruses), or an autoimmune reaction. Six notable exanthematous infections in children are:

1. **Measles** (caused by the measles virus)
2. **Scarlet Fever** (caused by the *Streptococcus pyogenes* bacterium)
3. **Rubella** (caused by the rubella virus)
4. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome** (caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*)
5. **Erythema Infectiosum** (caused by parvovirus B19)
6. **Roseola Infantum** (caused by HHV-6 and HHV-7)

## Diagnosis

### Measles

- **Features:**
  - **Prodrome:** Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis
  - **Koplik Spots:** Appear on the tongue before the rash
  - **Rash:** Begins behind the ears and spreads throughout the body
- **Complications:**
  - **Otitis Media:** Most common complication
  - **Pneumonia:** Leading cause of death

### Scarlet Fever

- **Features:**
  - **Fever:** Lasts 24-48 hours, preceding headache and tonsillitis
  - **Strawberry Tongue:** Characteristic appearance
  - **Rash:** Fine punctate erythema starting on the torso, spreading to palms and soles, described as 'sunburnt with goose pimples' and a rough sandpaper feel
- **Complications:**
  - **Otitis Media:** Most common complication

### Rubella

- **Features:**
  - **Prodrome:** Low-grade fever
  - **Lymphadenopathy:** Suboccipital and postauricular
  - **Rash:** Maculopapular, first on the face, then the body

- **Complications:**
  - **Pregnancy Risk:** Can lead to congenital rubella syndrome if contracted during pregnancy

### Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome

- **Features:**
  - **Infants:** Develop fever and malaise
  - **Infection:** Purulent, crusting around eyes, nose, mouth, progressing to widespread erythema and blistering
  - **Nikolsky’s Sign:** Positive, indicating epidermal separation on gentle pressure

### Erythema Infectiosum

- **Features:**
  - **Symptoms:** Often asymptomatic or mild fever
- **Rash Progression:**
  - **Phase 1:** Slapped cheek appearance
  - **Phase 2:** Raised net/lace-like rash on buttocks and trunk
  - **Phase 3:** Recurrence triggered by heat, sunlight, or warm bath
- **Complications:**
  - **Fetal Infection:** Can lead to hydrops fetalis during pregnancy
  - **Aplastic Crisis:** Occurs in sickle-cell disease patients due to suppressed erythropoiesis

### Roseola Infantum

- **Features:**
  - **Prodrome:** Sudden high fever lasting 3-4 days
  - **Rash:** Maculopapular, starting on neck and trunk, spreading to face and extremities
  - **Nagayama Spots:** Papular enanthem on uvula and soft palate
- **Complications:**
  - **Febrile Convulsions:** Occur in 10-15% of children

## Investigations

Most exanthems can be diagnosed clinically due to their distinct patterns, but additional diagnostic tests may include:

- **Viral Swab:** For culture, immunofluorescence, and PCR
- **Blood Tests:** For serology
- **ASO/Anti-DNAse B Titres:** To diagnose scarlet fever
- **Genotyping**

## Management

### Prescribing

Management depends on the specific cause:

1. **Measles:** Supportive care with ibuprofen or paracetamol for fever. Avoid aspirin due to the risk of Reye syndrome.
2. **Scarlet Fever:** 10-day course of oral penicillin; erythromycin for penicillin-allergic patients.
3. **Rubella:** No specific treatment. Surgical correction for congenital heart defects and cataracts in congenital rubella syndrome.
4. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome:** IV flucloxacillin and analgesia.
5. **Erythema Infectiosum:** Supportive treatment, commonly using antipyretics.
6. **Roseola Infantum:** Supportive care; antiepileptic drugs are not recommended for febrile convulsions due to roseola.

### Non-Prescribing

Most children recover without specific treatment, but:

- **Moisturizers:** Help relieve erythematous and itchy rashes.
- **Fluid Balance:** Monitor carefully in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome due to high sepsis risk.

**Warning:** Continuous monitoring of vital signs is crucial during management.
