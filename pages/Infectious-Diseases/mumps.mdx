# Understanding Mumps: Diagnosis, Management, and Complications

Mumps is an infectious disease caused by the RNA virus known as _Mumps orthorubulavirus_, which is part of the _Paramyxoviridae_ virus family. Transmission occurs through respiratory secretions or direct contact. It is important to consider a mumps infection in individuals presenting with relevant symptoms, regardless of their vaccination status against the virus.

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms

Mumps can present with a variety of symptoms, including:

- **Fever**: Elevated body temperature
- **Headache**
- **Myalgia**: Painful muscles
- **Fatigue**: General tiredness
- **Anorexia**: Loss of appetite

Additionally, mumps may cause unilateral or bilateral parotitis, characterized by swelling of the parotid glands. Complications can lead to further symptoms such as:

- **Orchitis**: Inflammation of the testes
- **Oophoritis**: Inflammation of the ovaries
- **Meningitis**: Symptoms include fever, headache, and neck stiffness
- **Encephalitis**: Inflammation of the brain
- **Hearing Loss**
- **Arthritis**
- **Pancreatitis**
- **Mastitis**: Inflammation of breast tissue
- **Myocardial Abnormalities**

## Investigations

Detection of a mumps infection can be performed through:

- **Virus Culture**
- **Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)**
- **Mumps IgM Antibody Testing** in the serum

For suspected cases of mumps meningitis or encephalitis, a lumbar puncture may be conducted to analyze cerebrospinal fluid.

## Emergency Diagnosis and Management

While mumps meningitis is generally less severe than bacterial forms, mumps encephalitis requires immediate attention due to its potential severity and risk of death. Signs indicating encephalitis include:

- **Seizures**
- **Altered Consciousness**: Changes in alertness or awareness
- **Focal Neurological Signs**

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Mumps encephalitis demands urgent care with antipyretics and anticonvulsants. In severe cases, tracheostomy and enteral feeding via a gastric fistula may be necessary.

## Management (Prescribing)

Mumps is typically self-limiting, resolving within a few weeks, and there are no specific antiviral drugs for mumps. Symptomatic treatment options include:

- **Analgesics**: For pain relief
- **Antipyretics**: To reduce fever
- **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**: To manage conditions like orchitis

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Non-pharmacological measures can help alleviate symptoms, including:

- **Bed Rest**
- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake
- **Compresses**: Warm or cold compress application to painful areas like the parotid glands or testicles
