# Understanding Herpes Zoster (Shingles)

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is a painful rash characterized by blistering. It results from the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpesvirus family. Initially, VZV causes chickenpox, a widespread rash often seen in children. After recovery, the virus remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia of spinal nerves and can reactivate later in life, causing a dermatomal rash.

## Key Characteristics

- **Herpes Zoster Oticus**: This involves the facial nerve's geniculate ganglion, potentially causing hearing loss and facial paralysis.
- **Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus**: This affects the trigeminal nerve's ophthalmic division, leading to vision problems.
- **Herpes Zoster Sine Herpete**: A rare form without a rash.

**Note:** Herpes zoster is more prevalent and severe in older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and pregnant women.

## Diagnosis

Herpes zoster typically presents as a painful, blistering rash affecting one or more dermatomes, often preceded by itching or pain. The thoracic region is most commonly affected. The rash becomes non-infectious when all lesions crust over, usually within 5-7 days.

### Risk Factors

- **Age**: Increased risk with advancing age.
- **Sex**: More common in females.
- **Immunocompromise**: Conditions like HIV or chemotherapy increase risk.
- **Stress and Concurrent Infections**: These can trigger reactivation.
- **Pregnancy**: Higher risk for complications.

### Herpes Zoster Oticus

This condition affects the eighth cranial nerve, leading to:

- **Unilateral Facial Paralysis**
- **Vertigo**
- **Ipsilateral Hearing Loss**
- **Tinnitus**

### Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus

Symptoms affecting the fifth cranial nerve include:

- **Photophobia**
- **Eye Pain**
- **Lacrimation**
- **Vision Loss**
- **Redness and Swelling Around the Eye**

## Investigations

Diagnosis is primarily clinical. If uncertain, PCR testing of lesions or blood can confirm VZV. MRI may be needed for neurological symptoms. HIV testing is recommended for frequent infections.

## Complications

- **Pneumonia**
- **Encephalitis**
- **Secondary Infections**
- **Post-herpetic Neuralgia**
- **Permanent Vision or Hearing Loss**

### Special Considerations in Pregnancy

Pregnant women without prior chickenpox exposure need testing for varicella antibodies. If negative, varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) should be administered within 10 days of exposure. Oral or IV aciclovir is used for treatment based on gestational age and severity.

#### Foetal Varicella Syndrome

This syndrome can occur if varicella is contracted early in pregnancy, leading to:

- **Eye Defects**
- **Limb Hypoplasia**
- **Neurological Issues**

## Management

### Prescribing

Antiviral therapy is most effective within 72 hours of symptom onset. Typical regimens include:

- **Aciclovir**: 800mg orally, five times daily for 7-10 days.
- **Alternatives**: Valaciclovir or famciclovir.
- **Corticosteroids**: For ophthalmicus.
- **Analgesics**: Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain.
- **Surgery**: For severe ocular complications.

### Non-Prescribing

Advise patients to maintain hygiene and avoid contact with vulnerable individuals. Vaccination is crucial for prevention, with two vaccines available in the UK: Zostavax (live) and Shingrix (recombinant).

  {
    question: "A 55-year-old female presents with a painful, blistering rash on her right thoracic region. She reports the rash started three days ago and was preceded by severe itching. She has a history of hypertension and is currently on lisinopril. What is the most appropriate antiviral treatment regimen for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Aciclovir 800 mg orally, five times daily for 7-10 days",
      "Amoxicillin 500 mg orally, three times daily for 7-10 days",

      "Acyclovir 200 mg orally, three times daily for 7-10 days"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Aciclovir 800 mg orally, five times daily for 7-10 days is the recommended treatment for herpes zoster, especially when started within 72 hours of rash onset.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the standard antiviral regimens for herpes zoster. Remember, the goal is to start treatment within 72 hours of rash onset to reduce complications and severity."
  },
  {
    question: "A 70-year-old man presents with unilateral facial paralysis, vertigo, and ipsilateral hearing loss. Vesicular lesions are noted on his ear. What cranial nerve is primarily affected in this condition?",
    options: [
      "Trigeminal nerve (CN V)",
