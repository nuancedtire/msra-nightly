# Comprehensive Guide to Dengue Fever

Dengue fever is a viral infection caused by an RNA virus from the Flaviviridae family, primarily spread by the Aedes mosquito. It has four distinct serotypes, and co-infection with multiple serotypes occurs in about half of all cases. While classical dengue fever is more prevalent in adults, severe forms, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, are more common in children. The disease is endemic in over 100 countries, especially in tropical regions.

## Diagnosis

Dengue fever is not transmitted within the UK, so the primary risk factor is recent travel (within the last two weeks) to an endemic area. Individuals who are pregnant or at the extremes of age are at higher risk for severe outcomes.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies clinical findings into three categories to aid in management stratification:

**Dengue Fever (Presumed Diagnosis):**

- Fever
- Plus any two of the following: 
  - Clinical Findings: Nausea, rash, muscle/joint pain
  - Investigation Findings: Leukopenia, positive tourniquet test

**Dengue Fever with Relevant Background/Warning Signs:**

- Meets criteria for dengue fever
- Plus any of the following: 
  - Background: Existing comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, renal failure), pregnancy, age extremes, isolation, or unable to access emergency care
  - Clinical Findings: Abdominal pain, vomiting, signs of fluid overload, liver enlargement, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness
  - Investigation Findings: Increased hematocrit with thrombocytopenia

**Severe Dengue Fever:**

- Meets criteria for dengue fever
- Plus severe levels of: 
  - Organ impairment
  - Hemorrhagic phenomena
  - Plasma leakage leading to dengue shock syndrome ± fluid overload and acute respiratory distress

## Investigations

A variety of tests are employed to diagnose dengue fever and assess any complications.

**Diagnostic Tests:**

- **Gold-standard:** **Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction** (RT-PCR)
- **In Resource-Limited Settings:** IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
  - Dengue suggested by: Positive IgM and IgG in a single sample
  - Dengue confirmed by: Seroconversion of IgM/IgG or a four-fold IgG increase in paired samples

**Further Blood Tests:**

- Complete Blood Count: Leukopenia, increased hematocrit with thrombocytopenia (warning sign)
- Liver Function Tests: Elevated enzymes, low albumin levels (indicating plasma leakage)
- Serology: Detection of non-structural protein 1 via ELISA

**Imaging (for complications, particularly fluid accumulation):**

- Chest X-ray: Checks for pleural effusion, pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome)
- Abdominal Ultrasound: Evaluates ascites

## Emergencies Related to Dengue Fever

The two severe forms of dengue fever recognized in the previous WHO classification are dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.

**Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever:**

- Duration: 7-10 days
- Clinical Findings: Fever, hemorrhagic signs (e.g., positive tourniquet test), liver enlargement, circulatory failure
- Investigation Findings: Plasma leakage (elevated hematocrit/low albumin), thrombocytopenia
- Treatment: Plasma loss replacement

**Dengue Shock Syndrome:**

- Duration: 1-2 days (rapid recovery or deterioration), occurs after fever subsides (2-7 days)
- Fulfills dengue hemorrhagic fever criteria
- Plus either of:
  - Rapid/weak pulse with narrow pulse pressure (`<20 mmHg`)
  - Hypotension with cold/clammy skin and restlessness
- Treatment: Volume replacement therapy

## Management

### Prescribing

Management varies according to the WHO classification:

**Dengue Fever:**

- Conservative: Recommend sufficient rest, oral fluid intake, and pain relief
- Discharge Criteria: Stable hematocrit 
  - Safety Net: Immediate return if warning signs develop

**Dengue Fever with Relevant Background/Warning Signs:**

- Conservative (if only relevant background): Encourage oral fluids, then IV fluids if not tolerated
- Medical (if warning signs present): IV fluids (0.9% saline/Ringer’s Lactate) adjusted based on clinical response 
  - Increase if: Deteriorating observations, rapidly rising hematocrit
  - Decrease if: Adequate oral intake/urine output, hematocrit below baseline

**Severe Dengue Fever:**

- Compensated Shock: 
  - IV crystalloid resuscitation
  - Titrate down if improvement noted
  - If no improvement, and repeat hematocrit:
    - Increases/remains high: Administer second crystalloid bolus, then titrate down if improved
    - Decreases: Indicates bleeding, cross-match, and transfuse
- Hypotensive Shock:
  - IV resuscitation with crystalloids/colloids
  - Titrate down if improvement observed
  - If no improvement, and initial hematocrit (pre-first bolus):
    - High: Administer second colloid bolus, then titrate down if improvement, return to crystalloids
    - Low: Indicates bleeding, cross-match, and transfuse
  - If still no improvement, and repeat hematocrit (post-second bolus):
    - Increases/remains high: Administer third colloid bolus, then titrate down, revert to crystalloids
    - Decreases: Indicates bleeding, cross-match, and transfuse
- Hemorrhagic Complications: Administer fresh packed red cells/whole blood

**Warning:** Fluid replacement must be carefully managed to avoid exacerbating fluid overload.

### Non-Prescribing Management

As dengue is a viral hemorrhagic fever, it should be reported to Public Health England.

Non-medical management focuses on monitoring key parameters to guide medical treatment, such as:

- Warning signs (clinical/investigation findings)
- Observations: Temperature, urine output, perfusion
- Blood tests: Hematocrit, white cell and platelet counts, organ function tests
