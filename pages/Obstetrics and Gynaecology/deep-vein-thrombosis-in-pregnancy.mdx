# Deep Vein Thrombosis in Pregnancy

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition that can occur during pregnancy, leading to potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism (PE). This article provides a comprehensive overview of DVT, including its diagnosis, management, and the importance of thromboprophylaxis in high-risk pregnancies.

## Understanding DVT and Its Risks

Pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which encompasses both DVT and PE. If a DVT dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can cause a PE, which is the leading direct cause of maternal death in the UK. Consequently, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has established guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women at high risk of VTE.

## Risk Factors for VTE in Pregnancy

High-risk factors for VTE during pregnancy and the puerperium are categorized into three main groups:

- **Pre-existing risk factors**: Previous VTE, thrombophilia, prolonged admission, age over 35, BMI of 30 or higher, parity of 3 or more, smoking, and severe varicose veins.
- **Obstetric risk factors**: Cesarean section, multiple pregnancies, prolonged labor over 24 hours, stillbirth, preterm birth, and significant postpartum hemorrhage.
- **Transient risk factors**: Surgical procedures, bone fractures, hyperemesis with dehydration, admission or immobility for 3 or more days, systemic infections, assisted reproductive technology, and long-distance travel over 4 hours.

Despite these factors, some women may still present with VTE during pregnancy, necessitating prompt recognition and diagnosis.

## Diagnosis of VTE

### DVT

DVT occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. Classic symptoms include:

- Pyrexia and leg pain
- Swelling
- Erythema
- Oedema, often on the left side due to iliac and/or femoral vein involvement

**Diagnostic methods** include Doppler ultrasound and MR venograms.

### PE

PE occurs in about 1 in 2,000 pregnancies. Classic symptoms include:

- Dyspnoea
- Collapse
- Chest pain
- Haemoptysis
- Raised JVP
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnoea

PE may also be accompanied by DVT symptoms. **Diagnostic methods** include CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scans.

### Cerebral Venous Thrombosis

Cerebral venous thrombosis is rare, with an occurrence rate of 1 in 10,000 pregnancies. Symptoms may include headache and/or stroke during the puerperium. **MRI** is the preferred diagnostic tool.

## Investigations

### For Suspected DVT

- **D-dimer**: Not typically useful due to naturally elevated levels during pregnancy.
- **Doppler ultrasound** or **MR venogram** for confirmation.

### For Suspected PE

- **Chest X-ray**, **ECG**, and **arterial blood gas** analysis.
- **Portable echocardiogram** for unstable patients.
- **CTPA** or **V/Q scan**: CTPA poses a higher breast cancer risk and may yield nondiagnostic scans, while V/Q scanning increases the risk of fatal childhood cancer. V/Q is preferred for younger women, those with a family history of breast cancer, or those with previous chest CT scans.
- **Lupus anticoagulant**, **anticardiolipin**, and **anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies** measurements (twice, >3 months apart) are necessary for diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome.

## Management

### Thromboprophylaxis

- **Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)**, such as enoxaparin or dalteparin, is the first-line treatment for antenatal and postnatal thromboprophylaxis.
- The duration of LMWH treatment varies based on individual risk factors.
- Routine anti-Xa level monitoring is needed only for those with antithrombin deficiency.

### Antiphospholipid Syndrome

- Women with antiphospholipid syndrome should receive LMWH and aspirin.
- These pregnancies are considered high-risk and require serial ultrasounds and elective induction.

### Treatment for Confirmed DVT

- If DVT is confirmed via ultrasonography, no further investigation is necessary, and VTE treatment should continue.

### Management of PE

- Unstable patients with massive PEs may require thrombolysis, intravenous heparin, or thrombectomy.
- Stable patients are treated with LMWH.
