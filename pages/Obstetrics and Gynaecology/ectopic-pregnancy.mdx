# Ectopic Pregnancy: Diagnosis and Management

Ectopic pregnancies occur when an embryo implants outside the uterine lining, typically posing significant risks to the mother's health. This article covers the essential aspects of diagnosing and managing ectopic pregnancies, which represent 1-2% of all pregnancies and are primarily non-viable.

## Understanding Ectopic Pregnancies

Ectopic pregnancies most commonly occur in the fallopian tube's ampulla but can also be found in non-tubal locations such as the cervix, caesarean scar, abdominal cavity, and ovary. A rare condition called heterotopic pregnancy includes both ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies.

### Symptoms and Clinical Presentation

Patients with an ectopic pregnancy might exhibit minimal symptoms. Nonetheless, ectopic pregnancy should be suspected in women of reproductive age who experience the following:

- **Amenorrhea:** Typically for 6 – 8 weeks.
- **Abdominal Pain:** Lower quadrant, often mild, vague, and classically on one side.
- **Vaginal Bleeding:** Generally light, possibly brown in color.
- **Gastrointestinal Symptoms:** Diarrhoea and vomiting.
- **Dizziness and Light-headedness:** Suggestive of blood loss.
- **Shoulder-tip Pain:** Indicates haemoperitoneum and diaphragmatic irritation.
- **Haemodynamic Instability:** A sign of possible rupture.

During a pelvic examination, cervical excitation may be noted, but probing for an adnexal mass is usually avoided due to the risk of causing rupture.

### Risk Factors

Between 25-50% of women with an ectopic pregnancy have identifiable risk factors:

- Prior ectopic pregnancy, with a recurrence risk of 10–20%.
- Utilization of assisted reproductive technology.
- Conditions like pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis.
- History of pelvic or tubal surgery.
- Smoking habit.

## Diagnostic Approach

The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can be established through ultrasound or surgical exploration. Key diagnostic steps include:

### Initial Investigations

- **Urine Pregnancy Test:** To confirm pregnancy.
- **Transvaginal Ultrasound Scan (TVUS):** Performed if the pregnancy test is positive.

### Blood Tests

- **β-hCG Levels:** Values above 1,500 IU per ml without an intrauterine pregnancy on TVUS suggest an ectopic pregnancy. Serial measurements aid in managing a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL).

## Management Strategies

Management involves collaboration with a consultant gynaecologist and takes into account the patient's specific circumstances, including proximity to medical facilities. There are three primary management approaches:

1. **Conservative (Expectant):**
   - The ectopic pregnancy might resolve naturally.
   - Monitor serial hCG levels on days 2, 4, and 7 post-initial test. If levels do not decrease by at least 15%, consider medical or surgical intervention.

2. **Medical:**
   - Administer Methotrexate intramuscularly to halt the growth of foetal tissue.
   - Follow-up includes serial hCG level checks and monitoring of full blood count (FBC) and liver function tests (LFT).
   - Advise against alcohol for two weeks and recommend reliable contraception for three months due to methotrexate's teratogenicity.

3. **Surgical:**
   - In stable cases, opt for laparoscopic salpingectomy or consider salpingostomy to preserve fertility if the other tube is compromised.
   - In unstable cases, perform rapid assessment and execute emergency laparoscopic surgery or laparotomy as needed.

**Warning:** Always monitor vital signs continuously during the procedure.

### Considerations for Future Pregnancies

Approximately 70% of women without a history of subfertility successfully conceive after an ectopic pregnancy, regardless of the management method chosen. However, subfertile patients have lower success rates post-surgery compared to those managed conservatively or medically. The risk of a subsequent ectopic pregnancy remains consistent across all treatment options.

Rhesus-negative women only require anti-D prophylaxis if the ectopic pregnancy is managed surgically.

  {
    question: "A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset of lower abdominal pain and light vaginal bleeding. She reports that her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. A positive urine pregnancy test leads to a transvaginal ultrasound scan, which fails to show an intrauterine pregnancy. Her serum β-hCG level is measured at 2000 IU per ml. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    options: [
      "Immediate administration of intramuscular methotrexate",
      "Serial β-hCG measurements on days 2, 4, and 7",
      "Emergency laparotomy",
      "Administering anti-D prophylaxis immediately",
      "Repeating transvaginal ultrasound scan in a week"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound with a β-hCG level above 1,500 IU per ml, an ectopic pregnancy is likely. Serial β-hCG measurements are indicated to determine if the levels are falling, suggesting a resolving ectopic pregnancy or rising, necessitating further intervention.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While methotrexate is used to manage ectopic pregnancy, it is not the immediate next step without additional information. Consider the diagnostic steps outlined for a suspected ectopic pregnancy."
  },
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old woman with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease is being evaluated for a suspected ectopic pregnancy. Which of the following risk factors is most strongly associated with an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancies?",
    options: [
      "Use of intrauterine devices (IUDs)",
      "Multiparity",
      "History of pelvic inflammatory disease",
      "Nulliparity",
      "Advanced maternal age"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A history of pelvic inflammatory disease is a significant risk factor for ectopic pregnancy, as it can cause tubal damage and predispose to abnormal implantation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While some options may be associated with pregnancy complications, consider the risk factors that are specifically linked to an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancies."

  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman is diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. She is hemodynamically stable and expresses a desire to preserve her fertility. There is no evidence of a concurrent intrauterine pregnancy. What is the most appropriate initial management strategy?",
    options: [
      "Expectant management with close monitoring of β-hCG levels",
      "Immediate surgical intervention with laparoscopic salpingectomy",
      "Methotrexate administration and subsequent monitoring of β-hCG levels",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In a hemodynamically stable patient with a desire to preserve fertility and no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy, methotrexate administration and subsequent monitoring of β-hCG levels is the most appropriate initial management strategy.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's stability, desire to preserve fertility, and the absence of intrauterine pregnancy when choosing the most appropriate management strategy."

    options: [
      "After every ectopic pregnancy surgery regardless of gestational age",
      "Only if the ectopic pregnancy was managed with methotrexate",
