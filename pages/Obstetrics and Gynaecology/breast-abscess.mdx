# Breast Abscess: Diagnosis and Management

Breast abscesses represent a localized collection of pus within the breast tissue. These infections can be categorized into two distinct types and are important to diagnose and manage promptly to avoid complications.

## Types of Breast Abscesses

Breast abscesses are classified into:

- **Lactational Abscesses:**
  - Commonly found in breastfeeding women.
  - Typically located peripherally in the breast tissue.

- **Non-lactational Abscesses:**
  - Often develop from an extension of periductal mastitis.
  - Usually situated beneath the areola and may be linked to nipple inversion.
  - More prevalent among younger women, especially those who are immunocompromised, such as those with diabetes mellitus.

Approximately 3% of mastitis cases can progress into a breast abscess. The pathogens most commonly responsible include:

- *Staphylococcus aureus*
- *Escherichia coli*
- *Bacteroides*
- *Streptococci* (including alpha, beta, and non-hemolytic types)

## Diagnosis

The suspicion of a breast abscess arises with the following clinical presentations:

- Fever, malaise, and nausea, suggesting an infectious process like mastitis.
- A painful and swollen lump in the breast with accompanying redness, warmth, and edema.
- A history of recent mastitis events.
- Nipple discharge that is purulent in nature.

## Investigations

Urgent referral from primary to secondary care is necessary for patients who present with signs indicative of a breast abscess. Diagnostic confirmation and management are guided by ultrasound imaging. Features suggestive of a breast abscess on ultrasound include:

- A hypoechoic fluid collection.
- Absence of vascularity within the abscess.
- Acoustic enhancement due to the fluid.
- Presence of an echogenic or vascular rim surrounding the collection.

Mammography is infrequently utilized but may be recommended in specific cases:

- To rule out malignancy in lactational abscesses for patients older than 30 years.
- In non-lactational abscesses with an extended clinical course.
- Mammography findings could indicate skin thickening or an asymmetric mass/density.

## Management

### Prescribing Practices

Post-drainage antibiotic therapy is typically advised:

- **Primary Recommendation:**
  - Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid for non-lactating abscesses.

- **For Penicillin-Allergic Patients:**
  - A combination of erythromycin and metronidazole is an alternative.

### Non-Prescribing Measures

- Rapid assessment by general surgeons is crucial, along with diagnostic confirmation using ultrasound.
- Drainage procedures, either through ultrasound-guided needle aspiration or surgical intervention, should be carried out.
- The fluid obtained from drainage should be cultured to determine the most effective antibiotic therapy.

**Breastfeeding Guidance:** Women who are breastfeeding should continue to do so from both breasts, including the affected one. If direct breastfeeding is challenging, expressing milk manually or with a pump is encouraged until normal feeding can resume.

      "Breast carcinoma",
      "Fibrocystic breast disease"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the patient's status as a new breastfeeding mother and the presentation of fever, painful and swollen lump in the breast, and purulent discharge, a lactational breast abscess is the most likely diagnosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the patient's recent history of breastfeeding and the acute onset of symptoms typical of an infectious process. Which diagnosis fits this clinical scenario?"
