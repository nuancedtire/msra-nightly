# Breast Cancer: Patterns, Risk Factors, Staging, and Management

Breast cancer is a multifaceted disease, primarily originating from epithelial cells within the milk ducts. This article explores the various patterns of breast cancer, identifies risk factors, outlines the TNM staging system, and discusses both medical and surgical management strategies.

## Patterns of Breast Cancer

Breast cancers exhibit diverse patterns, which can be categorized as non-invasive and invasive.

### Non-invasive Breast Cancer

- **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)**
  - Commonly detected on mammograms as calcifications
  - Rarely symptomatic
  - Grading indicates the likelihood of progression to invasive cancer
  - High risk of becoming invasive

- **Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)**
  - Progression rate is uncertain, generally slow
  - Increases the risk of developing cancer in either breast
  - More prevalent in premenopausal women

### Invasive Breast Cancer

- **Infiltrating Ductal Cancer**
  - The most common form
  - Presents as a hard lump, may cause skin tethering
  - Detectable on mammograms

- **Infiltrating Lobular Cancer**
  - May cause thickening or skin tethering
  - Symptoms are often minimal
  - Challenging to detect on mammograms

- **Other Types Include:**
  - Mucinous, Medullary, Papillary, and Tubular Cancers

## Risk Factors for Breast Cancer

The following factors increase the risk of developing breast cancer:

- Age
- Prior radiotherapy to the chest, especially if under 35 years old
- Age at first childbirth, with older mothers at greater risk
- Genetic mutations in BRCA, p53, Cowden syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
- Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) usage for over 5 years after age 50
- Late menopause
- Early menarche
- Family history of breast cancer
- Obesity, which elevates estrogen levels
- Alcohol consumption
- Smoking

### Predictors of Recurrence

- Tumor size
- Histological subtype and grade
- Younger patient age
- Premenopausal status
- Receptor subtype
- Lymph node involvement

## Stages of Breast Cancer

Breast cancer staging employs the TNM system, which considers tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis.

<details>
<summary>TNM Staging System</summary>

- **Stage 0**: Non-invasive cancers like DCIS.
- **Stage 1**: Invasive cancers up to 2cm without lymph node involvement.
- **Stage 2**: Larger tumors or those with limited lymph node involvement.
- **Stage 3**: Large tumors with significant lymph node involvement.
- **Stage 4**: Metastatic breast cancer, often spreading to bone, liver, lungs, and brain.

## Diagnosis of Breast Cancer

Early detection is crucial for effective breast cancer treatment. Screening mammography is a cornerstone of diagnosis but is less useful before age 40 due to dense ductal tissue.

### Patient Pathways

- Urgent referral for symptomatic presentation
- Standard screening programs with follow-up for abnormalities

### Presenting Symptoms

- Painless, hard, and irregular mass, often benign if under age 50
- Nipple discharge, especially if bloody or clear
- Nipple tethering or inversion
- Ulceration
- Oedema or erythema in inflammatory cancers
- Paget's disease of the breast

### Signs of Metastasis

- Jaundice
- Bone pain
- Lymphedema, typically in the axilla
- Shortness of breath

### Constitutional Symptoms

- Weight loss
- Night sweats
- Appetite loss

## Investigations

A symptomatic breast mass undergoes a triple assessment: clinical examination, radiological imaging, and needle aspiration or biopsy.

### Examination

- Visual inspection and palpation of the breasts
- Blood tests, including CA-15-3 marker levels

### Imaging

- Mammography for patients over 40 or with suspected malignancy
- Ultrasound for patients under 35
- CT scans and isotope bone scans for suspected metastasis

### Biopsy Findings

- Tumor grade and proliferation index
- Hormone receptor status
- HER2 receptor status

**Note:** Fine needle aspiration is suitable for lymph node biopsies but not for breast tissue, where a core biopsy is preferred.

## Management of Breast Cancer

### Prescribing Treatments

- **Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy**: Used to shrink tumors before surgery.
- **Radiotherapy**: Indicated after local excision of invasive cancer.
- **Hormonal Therapy**:
  - Pre-menopausal: Estrogen receptor modulators or progesterone synthetics
  - Post-menopausal: Aromatase inhibitors, such as Anastrozole

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Careful monitoring is required due to potential side effects such as hot flushes, weight gain, mood changes, and thromboembolism for pre-menopausal treatments, and arthralgia, skin reactions, osteoporosis, and altered lipid profile for post-menopausal treatments.
</Callout>

### Adjuvant Therapy

- Trastuzumab for HER2 positive tumors, avoiding concurrent use with anthracyclines due to cardiac toxicity.

### Non-Prescribing Treatments

- **Surgical Options**:
  - Mastectomy, often with reconstruction
  - Oncoplastic breast reduction
  - Wide local excision
  - Lymph node excision for treatment or staging
  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for negative biopsies

Postoperative care includes oncologist referral for further treatment planning.

  {
    question: "A 52-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a palpable breast mass. Mammography reveals a 2.5 cm mass with microcalcifications, and a core biopsy confirms invasive ductal carcinoma. She is premenopausal with no family history of breast cancer. Which of the following factors is NOT a predictor of her risk of recurrence?",
    options: [
      "Tumor size greater than 2 cm",
      "Histological confirmation of invasive ductal carcinoma",
      "Postmenopausal status at diagnosis",
      "Lack of family history of breast cancer",
      "Premenopausal status at the time of diagnosis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Postmenopausal status is not a predictor of recurrence. Predictors of recurrence include tumor size, histological subtype and grade, younger patient age, premenopausal status, receptor subtype, and lymph node involvement.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember to consider the factors that are known to influence the risk of breast cancer recurrence, such as tumor characteristics and patient demographics."
