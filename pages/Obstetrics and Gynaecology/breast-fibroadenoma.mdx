# Breast Fibroadenoma: Diagnosis and Management

Breast fibroadenomas are the most common non-cancerous breast tumors found in women of reproductive age. They are composed of proliferating stromal and epithelial cells from the duct lobules. These growths are often linked to increased estrogen levels, such as those occurring before menstruation.

Fibroadenomas are highly unlikely to undergo malignant transformation. Typically, they can remain in situ with consistent monitoring, and about 30% of fibroadenomas decrease in size over a two-year period.

## Diagnosis

Fibroadenomas present as highly mobile lumps within the breast, earning the nickname "breast mouse." They have a rubbery feel when touched and are usually well-circumscribed, typically less than 5cm in diameter. Although usually solitary, they can sometimes be multiple and present in both breasts, particularly in patients with a strong family history.

### Clinical Examination

- Inspect the patient's breasts in seated or standing positions, then with raised arms.
- Palpation should be performed with the patient lying down, arms behind their head to facilitate palpation of both superficial and deep breast tissue, including the axillary area.

### Imaging

- **Mammography** (for patients over 40 years old) may reveal popcorn-like calcifications, particularly in postmenopausal women, and a well-defined mass.
- **Ultrasound** (for patients under 35 years old) typically shows a well-defined mass.

### Fine-Needle Aspiration

This procedure is indicated if atypical findings are present on imaging. It will reveal fibrous and glandular tissue.

## Management

### Monitoring

Most fibroadenomas pose minimal risk for cancer and are managed with regular monitoring. Fibroadenomas that are impalpable and demonstrate benign features on imaging or biopsy can be observed with imaging surveillance, although the frequency of ultrasound scans remains a topic of debate, with a 6- to 12-month interval being a reasonable approach.

### Surgical Intervention

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
**Note:** Surgical removal is considered if the fibroadenoma is larger than 3cm in diameter, or if the patient prefers it.
</Callout>

- New fibroadenomas in patients over 40 years old should generally undergo an excision biopsy, even when triple testing indicates a benign tumor, due to the increased risk of malignancy with age.
- Fibroadenomas that grow in size or exhibit atypical features on imaging should be re-biopsied or removed through excisional biopsy.
- Surgical options include lumpectomy or excisional biopsy.

    question: "A 29-year-old woman presents with a palpable, mobile, 2 cm lump in her right breast that she discovered one month ago. The lump is not tender and has a rubbery consistency. She has no family history of breast cancer and is currently not on any medications. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    options: [
      "Immediate surgical excision of the lump",
      "Fine-needle aspiration of the lump",
      "Initiation of breast cancer chemotherapy",
      "Ultrasound of the right breast",
      "Ordering a mammogram of both breasts"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the patient's age and the characteristics of the lump, an ultrasound is the most appropriate next step to further evaluate the breast mass and determine if it has features consistent with a fibroadenoma.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the most appropriate initial diagnostic approach for a young woman presenting with a breast lump that has a clinical picture suggestive of a benign process."
  },
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old woman with a known breast fibroadenoma has been undergoing regular monitoring with ultrasound for the past 2 years. The fibroadenoma has grown from 2cm to 3.5cm in diameter. The patient has no symptoms and the mass remains well-circumscribed with no atypical features on imaging. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Continue monitoring with regular ultrasounds",
      "Perform a core needle biopsy of the mass",
      "Initiate treatment with tamoxifen",
      "Proceed with surgical excision of the fibroadenoma",
      "Order a mammogram and fine-needle aspiration"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Surgical excision is considered for fibroadenomas larger than 3cm in diameter, those that grow in size, or if the patient prefers it. Since this patient's fibroadenoma has grown to 3.5cm, surgical excision is the most appropriate next step.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the size of the fibroadenoma and the recommended management strategies for fibroadenomas that demonstrate changes in size over time."
  },
  {
    question: "A 52-year-old woman with a recently diagnosed solitary fibroadenoma is undergoing a clinical breast examination. What finding is most consistent with this diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "An ill-defined, hard mass fixed to the chest wall",
      "A well-circumscribed, mobile mass with a rubbery feel",
      "A rash involving the nipple with underlying induration",
      "Bilateral nipple discharge and generalized breast tenderness",
      "Multiple lumps in both breasts with associated lymphadenopathy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A fibroadenoma typically presents as a well-circumscribed, mobile mass with a rubbery feel, which is consistent with the description in option B.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the typical characteristics of a fibroadenoma on physical examination and how they differentiate from other breast pathologies."

    question: "During the management of a 38-year-old woman with multiple small fibroadenomas, which of the following factors would most strongly suggest considering an excisional biopsy?",
    options: [
      "The patient's age",
      "Menstrual cycle-associated breast tenderness",
      "A family history of fibroadenomas",
      "A 1cm fibroadenoma that has remained stable in size",
      "An increase in size of one fibroadenoma on serial ultrasounds"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 4,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An increase in the size of a fibroadenoma on serial ultrasounds may indicate a need for re-biopsy or excisional biopsy to rule out malignancy, especially if the fibroadenoma exhibits atypical features.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider changes in the fibroadenomas over time and other risk factors that might prompt a more aggressive approach to management."
