# Chlamydia Trachomatis: Diagnosis and Management

_Chlamydia trachomatis_ is the leading sexually transmitted bacterium, predominantly affecting individuals aged 15 to 24.

## Understanding Chlamydia Infections

_C. trachomatis_ can lead to infections in various parts of the body, notably the genital tract and conjunctiva, and can also result in rectal and pharyngeal infections.

### Male Infection

- Accounts for 35-50% cases of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU).
- Symptoms post 1-3 week incubation may include:
  - Dysuria
  - Urethral discharge

### Female Infection

- Asymptomatic in up to 80% of cases.
- Symptoms when present:
  - Altered vaginal discharge
  - Intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding
  - Superficial dyspareunia
  - Lower abdominal pain
- Physical signs can include:
  - Mucopurulent cervicitis
  - Oedema and erythema of the cervix
  - Cervical friability
- Complications such as Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) occur in 10-20% of untreated pregnant women, increasing risks of chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.

## Diagnostic Approach

Diagnosis is confirmed using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) from urine or vaginal swab samples.

### Additional Investigations

- Light microscopy is useful for ruling out gonococci in male urethral swabs but will not visualize _C. trachomatis_.

NAAT remains the gold standard for diagnosing _C. trachomatis_ infections.

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Guidelines

For successful treatment, a course of antibiotics is recommended:

- **First-line treatments**:
  - Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days (contraindicated in pregnancy)
  - Azithromycin (safe for use during pregnancy)
  
- **Second-line treatments**:
  - Erythromycin (pregnancy-safe)
  - Ofloxacin (not for use during pregnancy)
  - *Test of cure* is advised 3-5 weeks post-treatment with second-line agents or for pregnant women.

### Non-Prescribing Measures

- Abstain from sexual activity until treatment completion by both patient and their partners.
- Implement contact tracing and partner notification.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Patients should be informed about the importance of abstaining from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have completed treatment to prevent re-infection and further spread.
