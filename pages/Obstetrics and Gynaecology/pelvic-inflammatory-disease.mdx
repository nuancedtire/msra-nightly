# Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): An Overview

## Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a complex infection affecting the upper genital tract in women, which can encompass the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and adjacent pelvic organs. Although the specific microbial cause often remains unidentified, the infection is typically polymicrobial in nature. The vaginal flora significantly contributes to the disease's etiology.

### Common Pathogens

Several pathogens are frequently implicated in the initiation of PID:

- Neisseria gonorrhoeae
- Chlamydia trachomatis
- Mycoplasma genitalium

Additionally, organisms from the lower reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts, such as Escherichia coli, anaerobes, and streptococci, may also play a role in PID development.

## Risk Factors

PID risk is influenced by various factors, which can be broadly categorized into sexual behaviors and medical procedures:

### Sexual Behavior-Related Risks:

- **Young age**: Younger females are at a higher risk.
- **Sexual activity**: Being sexually active increases risk.
- **Unprotected intercourse**: Lack of barrier protection during sex.
- **Multiple sexual partners**: Increases exposure to potential pathogens.
- **New sexual partner**: A recent change in partners.
- **History of STIs**: Previous sexually transmitted infections can predispose to PID.

### Uterine Instrumentation:

- Termination of pregnancy.
- Insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD).

## Pathophysiology

The organisms responsible for PID typically enter through the lower reproductive tract, either through sexual contact or uterine procedures. The ascending infection can lead to a range of inflammatory conditions:

- Cervicitis
- Endometritis
- Salpingitis
- Oophoritis
- Parametritis
- Tubo-ovarian abscesses
- Peritonitis
- Perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome)

**Note:** While most contraceptive methods do not significantly alter the risk of PID, the consistent use of condoms has been shown to provide protection.

## Complications

If PID is not promptly and adequately treated, several serious reproductive health issues can arise, even after the acute infection has resolved:

- Chronic pelvic pain
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Subfertility
- Hydrosalpinx (fluid-filled fallopian tubes)
- Recurrent PID
- Increased risk of ovarian cancer

## Clinical Presentation

Symptoms of PID can vary widely, ranging from no symptoms to severe presentations:

- **Asymptomatic**: No observable symptoms.
- **Acute symptomatic**: Includes lower abdominal pain, new or purulent vaginal discharge, abnormal menstrual bleeding (intermenstrual, post-coital, menorrhagia), dyspareunia (painful intercourse), fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, and pelvic organ tendernessâ€”a hallmark of PID. Right hypochondrial tenderness may suggest perihepatitis.

## Diagnosis

A high index of suspicion for PID is warranted in young or sexually active female patients presenting with pelvic discomfort and signs of cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of PID should prompt early treatment, while further assessments support the diagnosis. Additional signs indicating PID include:

- Fever (temperature >38.3Â°C)
- Mucopurulent vaginal discharge or cervical friability
- Elevated white blood cells in vaginal secretions
- Detection of genital infection with N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, or M. genitalium

## Investigations

Testing for infections and comorbidities at risk in women with PID should include:

- Urine pregnancy test
- Routine hematological tests: full blood count, CRP, ESR
- Microbiological investigations:
  - Endocervical and high vaginal swabs
  - Urinalysis and urine culture
  - Microscopy of vaginal discharge
  - Nucleic acid amplification tests for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and M. genitalium
  - Serologic testing for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B
- Pelvic ultrasound to assess for PID complications or alternative diagnoses

## Management (Prescribing)

Initiation of antimicrobial therapy is crucial given the high morbidity associated with PID. Treatment should target both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Empiric therapy for anaerobes and M. genitalium should be considered if there is a history of recent uterine instrumentation or severe PID.

### Hospitalization Protocol

For patients hospitalized with PID, the regimen includes:

- IV second-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefoxitin) and oral doxycycline.
- Alternative: IV clindamycin and gentamicin.

Following >24 hours of clinical improvement, therapy can transition from IV to oral doxycycline (14-day course). Metronidazole is added if there is a pelvic abscess, Trichomonas vaginalis infection, or bacterial vaginosis.

### Outpatient Treatment

For mild to moderate PID cases managed as outpatients:

- IM ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline (14-day course).
- Metronidazole addition is similar to hospital protocol but also includes patients with recent gynecological procedures.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Hospitalization criteria for PID patients include:

- Severe clinical illness (e.g., high fever, nausea/vomiting, severe abdominal pain)
- Suspected pelvic abscess
- Pregnancy
- Intolerance or non-response to oral antibiotics
- Diagnostic uncertainty

Surgical intervention could be necessary for:

- Drainage of a tubo-ovarian abscess
- Uncertain diagnosis of an adnexal mass
- Other PID sequelae
- Lack of response to IV antibiotics

Post-treatment, patients should receive counseling on medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and avoidance of sexual activity until treatment completion. Partner tracing and treatment within the past 60 days should be conducted to prevent reinfection. Contraceptive counseling should promote barrier methods and caution against IUDs, considering the increased risk of infection and ectopic pregnancy.

Patients should be re-evaluated within 72 hours for clinical improvement, with consideration for hospitalization and further treatment if necessary.
