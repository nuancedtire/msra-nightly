# Understanding Ovarian Cysts

Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled structures that form within the ovary. These benign entities are prevalent among women of all ages and can range greatly in size.

## Symptoms and Signs

Ovarian cysts can manifest in various ways, from being entirely symptom-free to causing significant discomfort or complications.

### Symptoms

- Often asymptomatic, discovered incidentally via pelvic imaging
- Pain or pressure in the lower abdomen or pelvic area, on either side
- Abdominal bloating or distension
- Ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity)
- If complicated by rupture or torsion:
  - Acute abdominal pain
  - Nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding
- Irregular menstruation and crampy abdominal pain are *not typically associated* with ovarian cysts

### Signs

- Adnexal mass, commonly detected
- Hirsutism, especially in cases of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

## Causes

The etiology of ovarian cysts varies depending on whether a woman is premenopausal or postmenopausal.

### Premenopausal Causes

- **Functional/Follicular Cysts:** Often resolve spontaneously
- **Corpus Luteal Cysts:** Result from ovulation-related hematomas
- **Theca Lutein Cysts:** Arise under high hCG levels, linked with multiple pregnancies or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
- **Dermoid Cyst (Teratoma):** Contains diverse tissues; surgical removal may be necessary
- **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):** Characterized by numerous persistent cysts
- **Endometriotic Cyst/Endometrioma:** Contains old blood; known as "chocolate cyst"
- **Pregnancy-Related Cysts:** Support early pregnancy and typically resolve later
- **Pelvic Infections:** Can result in abscess formation
- **Benign Growths**
- **Cancer:** Rare in premenopausal women

### Postmenopausal Causes

- **Benign Growths**
- **Cancer:** More common in postmenopausal women, especially with a family history of ovarian or related cancers

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing ovarian cysts involves a step-by-step evaluation:

1. General assessment to confirm mass presence and location
2. Immediate treatment considerations for acute symptoms or first trimester bleeding
3. Malignancy exclusion through detailed evaluation if indicated

### History and Physical Examination

- **Risk Factors:** Genetic predisposition (BRCA1/2, Lynch syndrome), infertility, endometriosis, smoking, intrauterine device use
- **Protective Factors:** Prior oral contraceptive use, breastfeeding, tubal ligation, previous pregnancy
- **Physical Findings Suggestive of Malignancy:** Solid, irregular, or fixed mass; nodularity in the posterior cul-de-sac; presence of ascites

Differentials are established based on the initial presentation of the cyst, encompassing both gynecological and non-gynecological causes.

## Investigations

A series of tests and scans are used to evaluate an adnexal mass:

- **Pelvic Ultrasound:** The primary tool for assessment
  - Characteristics of a simple cyst include round or oval shape, anechoic fluid, thin walls, no acoustic shadowing, and no internal Doppler flow
  - Malignancy indicators are solid components, thick septations, colour Doppler flow, ascites, and presence of peritoneal masses
- **MRI or CT Scan:** For further evaluation
- **Urine Pregnancy Test:** To rule out pregnancy
- **Tumour Markers:** Including CA-125, AFP, hCG, LDH, CEA, and CA19-9
- **Surgery:** For histologic evaluation or therapeutic intervention
- **Cystic Fluid Aspiration:** Not recommended in postmenopausal women due to risks of recurrence and inaccurate malignancy detection

## Management

### Prescribing

- **Analgesics:** For pain management in low-risk cases
- **Oral Contraceptives:** To decrease the risk of epithelial ovarian neoplasms and aid in the resolution of benign cysts

### Non-Prescribing

Management strategies vary based on the cyst's cause and clinical presentation. Options range from conservative monitoring to surgical intervention.

#### Ruptured Cysts

- **Uncomplicated Ruptures:** Expectant management, with surgery if necessary
- **Complicated Ruptures:** Hospitalization for observation and fluid replacement; surgery in cases of hemodynamic instability

#### Asymptomatic Cysts

- **Conservative Approach:** Monitoring with follow-up ultrasounds
- **Surgical Approach:** Considered for large, painful, or potentially malignant cysts, or those caused by endometriosis affecting fertility

During pregnancy, most cysts are benign and resolve spontaneously. Surgical removal, if needed, is performed in the second trimester.
