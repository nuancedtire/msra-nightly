# Epiglottitis (Supraglottitis)

Epiglottitis (supraglottitis) refers to **inflammation** of the epiglottis and surrounding supraglottic structures, representing a medical emergency due to the risk of life-threatening airway obstruction.

### Anatomy of the Epiglottis

The epiglottis is a thin cartilage that forms the back wall of the vallecular space, located below the base of the tongue and extending into the larynx. There is a potential space between the epithelium and lamina propria on the anterior (lingual) surface, where edema may collect. **Swelling** can rapidly involve the entire supraglottic larynx, narrowing the upper airway and causing turbid airflow during inspiration, leading to **stridor**.

### Causes of Epiglottitis

Causes can be classified into infectious and non-infectious:

- **Infectious Causes**:
  - **Children**: 
    - Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) 
    - Other H. influenzae types A, F, and nontypeable
    - Streptococci (including group A strep)
    - Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA)
  - **Adults**: 
    - Streptococcus pneumoniae
    - H. influenzae type b (Hib)
  - **Immunocompromised**: 
    - Pseudomonas aeruginosa
    - Serratia spp.
    - Anaerobic flora
    - Candida spp.

- **Non-Infectious Causes**:
  - Traumatic: thermal injury, foreign body ingestion, caustic ingestion
  - Lymphoproliferative diseases (post-transplant complications, graft-versus-host disease)
  - Chronic granulomatous diseases (e.g. sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus)

### Clinical Features

*The clinical features of epiglottitis differ based on age, severity, and etiology:*

- **In Young Children**:
  - Sudden onset and rapid progression of:
    - **Dysphasia**
    - **Drooling**
    - **Distress** (“the three D’s”)
  - Often assume a "tripod" posture (leaning forward, neck hyperextended)
  
- **In Adults**:
  - Common complaint of severe sore throat, typically at lower risk for rapid deterioration.

### Diagnosis

Suspected epiglottitis is a medical emergency where airway control takes precedence over diagnostic evaluations. Key considerations include:

- High suspicion in young children inadequately immunized against H. influenzae type b (Hib) presenting with characteristic symptoms.
- Adults with disproportionate sore throat findings.

**Visual examination** of the epiglottis is crucial for diagnosis but should be done cautiously:

- **Safe Examination Methods**:
  - Direct pharyngoscopy with tongue blade
  - Fibre-optic nasolaryngoscopy
  - Indirect laryngoscopy with a 70-degree endoscope

**Indicative Findings**:
- Inflammation and edema of supraglottic structures
- Pooled secretions
- Tender laryngotracheal complex

- If examination is unsafe, **lateral neck radiographs** may assist, revealing signs of epiglottitis:

| Radiographic Features                 | Significance                |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Enlarged epiglottis ("thumb sign")   | Classic sign of epiglottitis |
| Loss of vallecular air space          | Indicates significant swelling|
| Thickened aryepiglottic folds        | Inflammation of structures   |
| Distended hypopharynx                 | Suggests obstruction        |
| Straightened/reversed cervical lordosis| Reflects airway compromise   |

### Investigations

Laboratory studies should only occur after securing the airway. Investigations may include:

- Complete blood count with differential
- Blood cultures
- Epiglottal cultures (only in intubated patients)

### Management (Prescribing)

**Airway maintenance** is the top priority:

- Interventions include:
  - Bag-valve-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen
  - Oral endotracheal intubation
  - Surgical airway (e.g., cricothyroidectomy)

**Antibiotic Therapy**: 
- Initiate after cultures (if possible). Empirical treatment includes third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., `Ceftriaxone`) for 7 to 10 days. Add **anti-staphylococcal agents** (e.g., `Vancomycin`) for complications like severe sepsis or areas with clindamycin-resistant MRSA.

**Sustained Monitoring**:
- Daily assessment of the supraglottis for therapy response, complications, and airway obstruction.

**Warning:** Supraglottic airway devices (e.g., laryngeal mask airway) are ineffective in acute upper airway obstruction.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- Avoid increasing anxiety in patients, especially children. Encourage them to sit comfortably, preferably on a parent's lap, and refrain from any painful procedures.

    question: "A 4-year-old child presents to the emergency department with drooling, dysphagia, and significant respiratory distress. Upon examination, the child is in a tripod position and is unable to speak. Which of the following findings would most likely be visualized during a careful examination of the airway?",
    options: [
      "Enlarged epiglottis",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An enlarged epiglottis, known as the 'thumb sign,' is a classic finding in epiglottitis, particularly in young children presenting with dysphagia, drooling, and respiratory distress. Immediate airway management is critical in these cases.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Remember that in epiglottitis, typical findings include specific changes in the anatomy of the epiglottis. Consider what symptoms are indicative of this condition and which findings would align with those symptoms."
