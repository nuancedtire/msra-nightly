# Parotid Gland Tumours

Parotid gland tumours have an **80% rule**: 
- **80%** of salivary gland tumours occur in the **parotid gland**. 
- Of these, **80%** are **benign**. 
- Among benign tumours, **80%** are **pleomorphic adenomas**.

## Classification of Parotid Gland Tumours

Parotid gland tumours can be classified into two major categories:

| **Epithelial**             | **Non-epithelial**          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Adenomas (benign)**      | **Carcinomas (malignant)**  |
| Pleomorphic adenoma        | Mucoepidermoid carcinoma     |
| Warthin’s tumour           | Adenoid cystic carcinoma     |
| Monomorphic adenoma        | Carcinoma ex-pleomorphic     |
| Oncocytoma                 | Acinic cell adenocarcinoma   |
|                            | Squamous cell carcinoma       |
|                            | Undifferentiated             |
|                            | Malignant lymphoma           |
|                            | Sarcoma                      |

The two most common parotid gland tumours are **pleomorphic adenoma** and **Warthin’s tumour**.

| **Pleomorphic Adenoma**                                      | **Warthin’s Tumour**                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Epidemiology**                                            | Second most common salivary gland tumour          |
| Most common benign salivary and parotid gland tumour       | Occurs only in parotid and exclusively in the superficial lobe |
| Occurs in younger patients `<50 years old`                 | Occurs in older, male smokers                      |
| **Histology**                                              | Cystic spaces lined by two-tiered epithelium, surrounded by dense lymphoid stroma with germinal centres |
| Heterogenous (epithelial cells, chondromyxoid and myoepithelial cells) |                                                   |
| **Features**                                               |                                                   |
| Slow-growing, painless swelling of the lower pole of the parotid | Slow-growing, soft to firm cystic, fluctuant swelling in the parotid tail |
| Irregular, lobulated surface, hard consistency             | May occur bilaterally                             |
| Does not invade or metastasise                             | Benign, no malignant potential                     |
| Low risk of malignant transformation                        |                                                   |
| Can recur if not completely excised                        |                                                   |

A **pleomorphic adenoma** that becomes malignant is known as a **malignant pleomorphic adenoma** or **carcinoma ex-pleomorphic**. This malignancy rarely occurs *de novo* and has the worst prognosis of all salivary gland tumours, with a high rate of recurrence and metastasis.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of parotid gland tumours is based on **clinical features**, **histology**, and/or **imaging**, with the most definitive diagnosis being made through tissue histology.

### Clinical Features Suspicious of Malignancy
- **Hyperemic hot skin** over a lump
- **Pain**
- **Fixation** to underlying structures or overlying skin
- **Hard consistency**
- **Irregular surface** or ill-defined border
- **Facial nerve involvement**

### Differential Diagnosis
- **Acute sialadenitis** – sudden enlargement, pain
- **Chronic sialadenitis** – less painful, abnormally firm, may be enlarged, normal or even atrophic in size
- **Mumps**
- **Sialolithiasis**
- **Sjogren’s syndrome**
- **Sarcoidosis**
- **Alcoholic liver disease**

## Investigations

- **Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)** — to determine benign vs malignant, guiding treatment
- **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan** — used if malignancy is suspected, to confirm salivary gland vs lymph nodes (multiple) and determine the extent of the tumour
- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** — used if malignancy is suspected, to determine the extent of the tumour
- **X-ray** — for stones
- **Sialography** — to visualize the ducts
- **Sialendoscopy** — to directly visualize the gland and ducts, allowing for the removal of stones or other foreign bodies

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Pleomorphic Adenoma
- **Surgical excision (modified Blair’s)**:
  - If superficial: **superficial parotidectomy**
  - If deep or large: **total parotidectomy** with preservation of the facial nerve

If malignant, perform a total parotidectomy with the sacrifice of the facial nerve (which can be grafted with the great auricular nerve) and **adjuvant radiotherapy**. If there is evidence of nodal metastases, a **radical neck dissection** is to be performed.

### Warthin’s Tumour
- **Conservative** if certain the entire mass is only composed of Warthin’s tumour cells.
- If bothersome: **superficial parotidectomy**.

### Complications of a Parotidectomy

**Immediate:**
- Intraoperative **facial nerve transection** → *LMN palsy (Bell’s sign)*
- Rupture of the capsule of the parotid tumour
- Incomplete surgical resection of the parotid tumour

**Early (`<1 month`):**
- Temporary **facial weakness** (neuropraxia of the facial nerve)
- Division of **great auricular nerve** → loss of sensation over the pinna
- **Parotid fistula**
- **Trismus** (inflammation and fibrosis of masseter muscle)
- Wound **infection/seroma**
- **Haemorrhage/hematoma**
- **First bite syndrome** (severe spasms and pain in the region of the parotid gland present upon the first bite of a meal, which diminishes with additional bites)
- **Skin flap necrosis**

**Late:**
- **Facial synkinesis** after facial nerve palsy (i.e., Bogorad’s syndrome) — aberrant regeneration of facial nerve causing hyperlacrimation on eating (i.e., Crocodile tears)
- **Frey’s syndrome** — aberrant regeneration of severed parasympathetic secretomotor fibres of the auriculotemporal nerve onto the sympathetic receptors innervating the sweat glands
- **Hypoaesthesia** of great auricular nerve
- **Recurrent tumour**
- **Cosmetic problems**: soft tissue deficit, hypertrophic scar/keloid

    question: "A 55-year-old male smoker presents with a soft, cystic swelling in the tail of his parotid gland. The swelling is fluctuant and has been present for the last 6 months. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) reveals abundant lymphoid stroma with cystic spaces lined by bilayered epithelium. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Pleomorphic adenoma",
      "Warthin’s tumour",
      "Mucoepidermoid carcinoma",
      "Adenoid cystic carcinoma",
      "Acinic cell adenocarcinoma"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The FNAC findings of abundant lymphoid stroma with cystic spaces lined by bilayered epithelium are characteristic of Warthin’s tumour, which commonly occurs in older male smokers. This benign neoplasm is typically well-circumscribed and may present as a cystic swelling in the parotid gland.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the histological features presented in the FNAC results: abundant lymphoid stroma and bilayered epithelium. Focus on the characteristics that distinguish benign tumours of the parotid gland, especially those associated with smoking history."
  },
  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman presents with a painless, slow-growing lump in the lower pole of her parotid gland. Imaging studies show a well-defined, heterogeneous mass. What is the most appropriate management for a confirmed pleomorphic adenoma?",
    options: [
      "Observation and monitoring",
      "Surgical excision (superficial parotidectomy)",
      "Radiotherapy",
      "Chemotherapy",
      "Sialendoscopy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Surgical excision, specifically a superficial parotidectomy if the tumour is superficial, is the appropriate treatment for a pleomorphic adenoma. This can help prevent recurrence, which is higher if the tumour is not completely excised.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the characteristics of pleomorphic adenoma and the standard treatment protocols. Why might a surgical approach be favored over observational management or non-surgical treatments in this case?"
  },
  {
    question: "During a parotidectomy to excise a pleomorphic adenoma, the surgeon identified and preserved the facial nerve. Which potential postoperative complication is most likely given the preservation of the nerve?",
    options: [
      "Permanent facial paralysis",
      "Frey's syndrome",
      "Crocodile tears",
      "Wound infection",
      "Parotid fistula"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! While preservation of the facial nerve reduces the risk of permanent facial paralysis, aberrant regeneration can lead to complications such as Frey's syndrome or crocodile tears. However, given preservation, the risk of this specific complication is lower than if the nerve was transected.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider what preservation of the facial nerve during surgery entails. Think about how the nerve's functionality can influence postoperative complications. What are common consequences of nerve preservation versus transection?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 40-year-old man presents with a firm lump in the right parotid gland, accompanied by pain and fixation to underlying structures. Which clinical feature is most suggestive of a malignant process in this case?",
    options: [
      "Painless swelling",
      "Firm consistency",
      "Irregular surface",
      "History of smoking",
      "Age over 50"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An irregular surface is a concerning feature and may indicate malignancy. Others suggestive of malignancy include pain, fixation to underlying structures, and hard consistency. Regular surveillance is vital in such scenarios.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Analyze the characteristic features of masses in the parotid gland. What does fixation to underlying structures or an irregular surface indicate compared to a smooth, mobile lump? Review the risk factors associated with parotid malignancies."
