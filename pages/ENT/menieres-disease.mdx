# Meniere's Disease: An Overview

Meniere’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear characterised by excessive endolymph (either due to excessive production or under-absorption) in the membranous labyrinth. The excessive endolymph leaks through the Reissner’s membrane into the perilymphatic space. The cause of Meniere’s disease is not well understood, but **immune-mediated aetiology** has been suggested.

## Diagnosis

Meniere’s disease typically affects adults between the ages of 40 and 60 years. The classical triad of Meniere’s disease includes:

- **Episodic tinnitus**
- **Sensorineural hearing loss**
- **Unprovoked vertigo** (irrespective of head movements)

Other symptoms may include:

- Vomiting
- Nausea
- Aural fullness
- **Rarely**, drop attacks (acute loss of balance)

These symptoms tend to occur as recurrent acute attacks lasting up to `hours` for each attack. In most cases, this affects one ear only, but as the disease progresses, the other ear can also be affected. Tinnitus and hearing impairment may become irreversible at later stages of the disease.

**Physical examinations** may reveal:

- Nystagmus towards the affected side
- Sensorineural hearing loss on the affected side
- Positive Onderberger test (the patient will be asked to march in position with their eyes closed; they will turn towards the affected side)
- Negative Dix-Hallpike test
- Inability to walk in a straight line

### Diagnostic Guidelines

Two acceptable guidelines to aid diagnosis of Meniere’s disease include:

1. **Gibson Point System**
2. **American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) 1995 Guidelines**

The Gibson point system is a scoring checklist out of a maximum of 10 points, based on the symptoms of the disease. The categories include:

| **Category**                  | **Criteria**                                                                                  | **Points** |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Hearing**                   | Sensorineural hearing difficulties                                                             | 1          |
|                               | Associated with one or more symptoms (Aural fullness, vertigo, or tinnitus)                   | 1          |
|                               | Fluctuating sensorineural hearing difficulties                                                | 1          |
| **Aural Fullness**            | Lasts more than `10 minutes`                                                                 | 1          |
|                               | Associated with sensorineural hearing difficulties                                             | 1          |
| **Tinnitus**                  | Lasts for more than `10 minutes`                                                              | 1          |
|                               | Associated with one or more symptoms (Sensorineural hearing difficulties, vertigo, or aural fullness) | 1          |
| **Vertigo**                   | Rotational vertigo                                                                             | 1          |
|                               | Lasts over `10 minutes`                                                                        | 1          |
|                               | Associated with one or more symptoms (Sensorineural hearing difficulties, tinnitus, or aural fullness) | 1          |

## Investigations

Diagnosis is primarily made clinically based on history and examination. However, **investigations** can be carried out to rule out other differential diagnoses. The following investigations are usually recommended:

- **Pure tone audiometry**: Typically shows a pattern of sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear, predominantly across low frequencies in earlier stages of the disease.
- **MRI brain with gadolinium contrast**: Imaging is primarily used to rule out vestibular schwannoma and other space-occupying lesions.
- **Electrocochleography**: Estimates the basilar membrane pressure by measuring nerve action potentials; one of the most sensitive tests for diagnosing active Meniere’s disease.

## Management (Prescribing)

**Diuretics** such as hydrochlorothiazide or acetazolamide have been shown to reduce the incidence of attacks but are not routinely recommended in primary care.

For symptomatic relief, the following medications are usually recommended:

- **Antiemetics**: Prochlorperazine, promethazine
- **Antihistamines**: Cyclizine, meclizine, diphenhydramine, betahistine
- **Benzodiazepines**: Diazepam

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

The first-line recommendation for all patients with Meniere’s disease is lifestyle changes, which include:

- Reduced salt intake
- Reduced caffeine intake
- Reduced alcohol intake
- Smoking cessation
- Stress control

These recommendations aim to reduce the incidence of acute attacks.

When pharmacological management fails or is not appropriate, non-pharmacological options may be offered:

- **Meniett Device**: Aims to reduce the frequency of vertigo by delivering micropressure into the ear canal; requires a tympanostomy tube.
- **Endolymphatic Sac Decompression Surgery**: Aims to relieve endolymphatic pressure.
- **Intratympanic Corticosteroid Injection**: Reduces symptoms during acute episodes.
- **Intratympanic Gentamicin Injection**: Destroys vestibular cells to reduce vertigo symptoms but may lead to irreversible sensorineural loss.
- **Vestibular Nerve Section**: Resects the eighth cranial nerve to reduce vertigo while conserving hearing.
- **Labyrinthectomy**: Removes inner ear structures and does not preserve auditory and vestibular function.

Patients undergoing vestibular destructive procedures should be offered vestibular and balance rehabilitation to cope with post-surgical symptoms.

Masking and hearing aids may assist patients with tinnitus and hearing loss, respectively.

It has been shown that up to **80%** of patients can control their symptoms using non-invasive management strategies.
