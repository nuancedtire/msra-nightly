# Otitis Externa Overview

Otitis externa (also known as **external otitis** or **swimmer’s ear**) refers to the generalised inflammation of the skin of the external auditory meatus. The condition can result from various factors and is often multifactorial.

## **Causes**

The causes of otitis externa include:

- **Trauma** from chronic ear digging or scratching
- **Swimming** or other water exposure
- **Occlusive ear devices** (e.g., hearing aids, earphones)
- **Allergic contact dermatitis** (e.g., due to shampoos, cosmetics)
- **Overuse** of topical antibiotics/steroid ear drops
- **Eczema/Psoriasis** – predisposition to infection from hypersensitivity and trauma

### **Microorganisms Involved**

Common microorganisms causing otitis externa include:

- *Pseudomonas Aeruginosa*
- *Staphylococcus Aureus*
- *Aspergillus niger*
- *Candida albicans* (otomycosis/fungal OE)

## **Symptoms**

Symptoms of otitis externa can include:

- **Otalgia** (ear pain)
- **Pruritus** (itching)
- **Otorrhoea** (ear discharge)
  - Green discharge suggests *P. Aeruginosa*
  - Creamy discharge suggests fungal infection
- **Hearing loss**

## **Signs**

Signs of otitis externa may manifest as:

- Tenderness of tragus and/or auricle on movement
- Erythema and swelling of the external auditory canal
- External ear canal filled with debris and discharge, possibly obscuring the tympanic membrane
- Cracked or crusting skin
- *Tympanic membrane* intact, may have swelling with granulation tissue (granular myringitis)

### **Severity Classification**

The severity of otitis externa can be categorized as follows:

| Severity    | Symptoms                                           |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Mild**    | Pruritus, minor discomfort, minimal canal oedema   |
| **Moderate**| Pruritus, intermediate pain, partially occluded canal|
| **Severe**  | Complete canal obstruction, intense pain, periauricular erythema, adenopathy, fever  |

## **Complications**

Potential complications of otitis externa include:

- **Perichondritis**
- **Facial cellulitis**

## **Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of otitis externa is primarily *clinical*, relying heavily on a classic history and physical examination. 

### **Differential Diagnosis**

Differential diagnoses to consider include:

- **Otomycosis**
- **Contact dermatitis**
- **Chronic suppurative otitis media**
- **Ear canal carcinoma**

**Malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa** occurs when the inflammation spreads to the skull base, with risk factors including older adults, diabetes, and immunocompromised states. Symptoms include severe pain, otorrhoea, granulation tissue in the canal, and possible cranial nerve palsies.

## **Investigations**

No specific investigations are required for otitis externa. However, an ear swab may be performed for microbiological examination in the following cases:

- Severe cases
- Immunocompromised patients
- Lack of response to initial therapy

## **Management (Prescribing)**

Management of otitis externa is based on the severity:

- **Mild:** 
  - Non-antibiotic topical preparation containing an **acidifying agent** and a **glucocorticoid** (e.g., Acetic acid-hydrocortisone)
  
- **Moderate:** 
  - Topical preparation that is acidic and contains an **antibiotic**, **antiseptic**, and a **glucocorticoid**. Example: *Topical Sofradex* (framycetin sulfate, gramicidin, and dexamethasone combination ear drop)
  - Topical *Canesten* (clotrimazole) ear drops TDS for 10 days if fungal

- **Severe:** 
  - Similar to moderate treatment but may require the use of a wick to enhance medication access
  - Topical *Canesten* (clotrimazole) ear drops TDS for 10 days if fungal
  - For deeper tissue infections (extension beyond the external auditory canal):
    - Systemic AND topical antibiotics
    - Oral *Ciprofloxacin* if facial swelling and/or cellulitis
      - If not recovering, consider **fungal** or **atypical infections**
  - **Analgesia:** e.g., NSAIDs, opioids

## **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

- **Aural toilet** (microsuction or dry mopping) should be the first step for all patients to remove bacterial load and debris, facilitating healing and enhancing penetration of topical ear drops.
  
- **Patient education:**
  - Avoid swimming/water entering the external ear canal (or use cotton wool mixed with hand lotion as earplugs) during bathing.
  - Avoid digging ears or inserting objects in the ear.

- After resolution of external auditory meatus inflammation, the tympanic membrane should be inspected to rule out middle-ear pathologies as an underlying cause.

- Patients with **malignant otitis externa** need prompt referral to an otolaryngologist.

  {
    question: "A 45-year-old man presents with a 1-week history of severe itching and pain in his ear after returning from a beach holiday. On examination, the external auditory canal is swollen and filled with grayish-green discharge. Which organism is most likely responsible for his condition?",
    options: [
      "Candida albicans",
      "Pseudomonas Aeruginosa",
      "Aspergillus niger",
      "Staphylococcus Aureus",
      "Bacteroides fragilis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of grayish-green discharge and the patient's recent beach exposure suggest a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which is commonly associated with otitis externa, especially in swimmers.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the characteristics of the ear discharge and the patient's history. Which organism is often associated with water exposure and is known for causing infections in the external auditory canal?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient is diagnosed with malignant otitis externa. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this condition?",
    options: [
      "Recent ear trauma",
      "Diabetes mellitus",
      "Use of hearing aids",
      "History of allergies",
      "Swimmer's ear"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Diabetes mellitus is a key risk factor for malignant otitis externa due to the immunocompromised state of patients with diabetes, making them more susceptible to severe infections.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider what predisposes a patient to serious infections. Which condition is known to impair immune response and make patients more vulnerable to severe complications?"
