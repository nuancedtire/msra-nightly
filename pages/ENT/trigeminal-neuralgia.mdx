# Trigeminal Neuralgia

Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by **severe facial pain** in the distribution area of the trigeminal nerve. It typically affects **3 in every 100,000 people**, with onset commonly occurring in those over **60 years** old.

## Pathophysiology

The disease is often **idiopathic**. However, in younger patients, trigeminal neuralgia may be secondary to:
- Central lesions of the trigeminal nucleus or nerve root (e.g. **multiple sclerosis** or **cerebellopontine angle tumors**).
- **Compression** of the dorsal root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve by the **superior cerebellar artery**, resulting in irritation and **demyelination** of the nerve, which leads to abnormal neuronal discharge.

Another noted risk factor for the disease is **hypertension**, and it is generally more common in **men**.

## Diagnosis

Patients typically report:
- **Unilateral shooting pain** in the face, usually over the second and third branches of the trigeminal nerve.
- The **eyes are rarely affected**.
  
If bilateral trigeminal neuralgia is present, it is often due to a **demyelinating pathology**. Characteristics of the pain include:
- Paroxysmal episodes, with multiple occurrences in one day.
- Pain remits before recurring.
- Presence of **sensory triggers** (e.g., shaving or brushing teeth may provoke pain).

Other physical signs, other than pain itself, are usually absent. However, signs of muscle wasting, sensory loss, or impaired reflexes may indicate a secondary cause.

### Diagnostic Criteria

A diagnosis can be made if:
- More than **3 attacks** are reported.
- Pain is limited to the trigeminal area.
- Features include:
  - Severe pain
  - Shock-like sensations
  - Short episodes lasting seconds
  - More than **3 episodes with a trigger**

## Investigations

Investigations, particularly for multiple sclerosis, should be performed in younger patients or those with bilateral pain.

Methods include:
- **MRI**: Can reveal white matter plaques in areas such as the corpus callosum, periventricular regions, brainstem, and cerebellum.
- **Visual evoked potentials**: Demonstrates decreased conduction velocity along axons in multiple sclerosis patients.

## Management (Prescribing)

The primary treatment involves **antiepileptics**, including:
- **Carbamazepine** (first-line)
- **Gabapentin**
- **Lamotrigine**

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

If patients fail to respond to first-line medical therapy or are younger than 50, a referral to neurology is warranted. Other treatments may include:
- **Ablation** of the trigeminal ganglion if medical management is ineffective.
- **Botulinum toxin** injections for patients who are refractory to medical treatment.

**Warning:** Patients with new-onset trigeminal neuralgia, especially those under 50, should be evaluated for possible secondary causes.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 3-month history of recurrent, unilateral facial pain described as sharp and shooting. The pain is primarily located in the distribution of the maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve and is triggered by light touch while shaving. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Cluster headache",
      "Trigeminal neuralgia",
      "Migraine",
      "Postherpetic neuralgia",
      "Temporomandibular joint disorder"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presentation is classic for trigeminal neuralgia, which involves unilateral, episodic facial pain often triggered by light stimuli. The description aligns with the typical features of this condition, particularly affecting the maxillary and mandibular branches.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the characteristic features of trigeminal neuralgia, which include unilateral shooting pain triggered by touch. Does your selected option involve recurrent facial pain, and is it triggered by light stimuli?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following investigations is most appropriate for evaluating a patient under 50 years old with new-onset trigeminal neuralgia?",
    options: [
      "CT scan of the head",
      "Tolerance tests",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)",
      "Electromyography (EMG)",
      "Lumbar puncture"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! MRI is the preferred imaging modality for younger patients with new-onset trigeminal neuralgia to rule out secondary causes such as multiple sclerosis or structural lesions.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the age of the patient and the need to investigate for potential demyelinating diseases. What imaging technique is best suited for evaluating neurological disorders in this context?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension presents with trigeminal neuralgia symptoms. Which of the following first-line medications is most commonly prescribed for her condition?",
    options: [
      "Topiramate",
      "Carbamazepine",
      "Gabapentin",
      "Lamotrigine",
      "Baclofen"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Carbamazepine is the first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia and is effective at reducing the frequency and intensity of pain episodes.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the standard treatment guidelines for trigeminal neuralgia. Which medication is recognized for its effectiveness as a first-line agent?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with trigeminal neuralgia undergoes treatment with carbamazepine. Which of the following side effects should the clinician monitor for in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Weight gain",
      "Drowsiness",
      "Decreased libido",
      "Agranulocytosis",
      "Hypertension"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Carbamazepine can cause agranulocytosis, a potentially serious side effect, so it is essential to monitor the patient's complete blood counts during treatment.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the adverse effects associated with antiepileptics, particularly carbamazepine. What rare but significant complication should raise concern for a clinician when treating patients?"
