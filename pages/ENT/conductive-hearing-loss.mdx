# Conductive Hearing Loss

Conductive hearing loss can be attributed to issues in the outer or middle ear. It is essential to identify the causes, diagnosis, investigations, and management options for effective treatment.

## Causes of Conductive Hearing Loss

Common causes include:

- **Cerumen impaction** – build-up of tightly packed wax in the outer ear.
- **Otitis media (with or without effusion)** 
  - Infection of the middle ear that may lead to **tympanic membrane perforation**.
  - *Most common in children.*
- **Otosclerosis** – abnormal bone growth, particularly at the stapes, leading to fixation at the oval window.

## Diagnosis

Patients with conductive hearing loss may report improved hearing in noisy environments. Common associated symptoms include:

- **Tinnitus**
- **Vertigo**
- **Otalgia** (ear pain)
- **Quiet speech** – patients perceive their own voice loudly due to better bone conduction.

In children with otitis media, signs may include systemic illness such as fever, lethargy, or irritability.

### Clinical Tests for Hearing Loss

When assessing hearing loss, several clinical tests can classify its severity:

1. **Whisper Test**
   - Whisper a number/phrase into one ear.
   - Occlude the non-testing ear.
   - Measure the distance required for the patient to no longer hear the whisper.

2. **Rinne Test**
   - Place a vibrating tuning fork (usually `512Hz` or `256Hz`) on the mastoid process to test bone conduction.
   - Once the sound is no longer heard, move the tuning fork in front of the auditory canal to test air conduction.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Normal/Sensorineural hearing loss: air conduction is better than bone conduction.
     - Conductive hearing loss: bone conduction is better than air conduction.

3. **Weber Test**
   - Place the vibrating tuning fork at the center of the forehead.
   - Ask the patient which ear is louder.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Louder in the affected ear: conductive hearing loss.
     - Louder in the unaffected ear: sensorineural hearing loss.
     - No difference: normal or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.

## Investigations

Following the diagnosis of conductive hearing loss, an otoscopy is performed to visualize the external ear and tympanic membrane. Observations may include:

- **Cerumen impaction** – visible wax.
- **Otitis media** – marked by a red, bulging tympanic membrane.
  - If perforated, a hole may be seen.
  - Signs of fluid behind the tympanic membrane (e.g., bubbles or fluid level).
- **Otosclerosis** – tympanic membrane may appear normal; however, Schwartze sign (a red-blue tympanic membrane) may be present.

Subjective or objective audiometry can help differentiate types of hearing loss not evident during an examination.

## Management of Conductive Hearing Loss

The approach to treating conductive hearing loss focuses on addressing its underlying cause:

- **Cerumen Impaction**:
  - Soften with olive oil drops followed by ear irrigation. 
  - Advise against using cotton buds.

- **Otitis Media**:
  - Most cases resolve in `1 to 4 days`.
  - Analgesia may be recommended.
  - *Antibiotics* (e.g., amoxicillin) may be indicated if bilateral disease or tympanic membrane perforation is present.
  - Referral to ENT is necessary if the child has bilateral otitis media with effusion (glue ear) or severe hearing loss for possible grommet insertion.

- **Otosclerosis**:
  - A referral to ENT is warranted for surgical options. The stapes may be replaced using:
    - **Stapedotomy** (partial replacement) 
    - **Stapedectomy** (complete replacement).

Additionally, a hearing aid may be indicated irrespective of the severity of hearing loss. Early fitting with a hearing aid in children is crucial to avoid delays in speech development.

         question: "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother due to complaints of ear pain and difficulty hearing. Upon examination, the physician notes a bulging, red tympanic membrane and fluid behind it. What is the most appropriate first-line treatment for this child's condition?",

           "Immediate referral for tympanostomy tube placement",
           "Prescribe amoxicillin",

         correctAnswer: 1,
         correctFeedback: "Correct! According to guidelines for acute otitis media, children under 6 months with severe symptoms should be treated with antibiotics. In your case, this child exhibits otitis media with an evident bulging and red tympanic membrane, making amoxicillin the appropriate first-line treatment.",
         incorrectFeedback: "Consider that management guidelines for otitis media suggest a more proactive approach in children with evidence of severe infection (such as a severe bulging tympanic membrane). What are the recommendations for starting antibiotics in these cases?"

         correctAnswer: 2,
         correctFeedback: "Correct! This finding indicates conductive hearing loss, where bone conduction is better than air conduction. This contrasts with normal or sensorineural hearing loss, where air conduction is better.",

         correctAnswer: 2,
         correctFeedback: "Correct! A Weber test that lateralizes to the affected ear is suggestive of conductive hearing loss on that side. The sound appears louder in the problematic ear due to the bone conduction being perceived better than air conduction.",
         incorrectFeedback: "Consider how the Weber test works. If sound is louder in one ear, what does that indicate about the type of hearing loss present? Revisit the clinical implications of lateralization in this test to empower your reasoning."

         options: [
           "Continue symptomatic treatment only",

         correctFeedback: "Correct! For children with a perforated tympanic membrane and persistent otitis media with effusion, it is often best to consider tympanostomy tube placement when hearing loss or recurrent infections occur. However, for straightforward management, observation is often preferred in simple cases, with follow-up to monitor the situation.",
