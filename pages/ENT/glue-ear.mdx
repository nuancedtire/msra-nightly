# Glue Ear (Otitis Media with Effusion)

Glue ear, also known as **Otitis Media with Effusion (OME)**, is a condition where the middle ear fills with fluid without signs of acute inflammation. The fluid resembles glue and can lead to temporary hearing loss. This condition is significantly more prevalent in children, primarily due to their narrower Eustachian tubes that are more susceptible to clogging, though it can also occur in adults. Glue ear is the leading cause of hearing impairment in children.

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms

Glue ear can present as either unilateral or bilateral:

- **Dulled Hearing**
  - Severity can vary
  - May worsen due to thicker fluid or colds
  - Prolonged cases (lasting more than a few months) can lead to **permanent hearing damage**

Mild earache or tinnitus may accompany the hearing loss:

- The glue-like fluid increases the probability of developing an ear infection, leading to more severe ear pain.

Adults may report a sensation of pressure deep in the ear and general tiredness.

### Signs of Glue Ear

Parents or caregivers may observe:

- **Increased Volume**
  - A child may speak more loudly or show difficulty hearing.
- **Ringing in Ears**
  - Children may express that they hear ringing sounds.
- **Ear Tugging**
  - Typically indicative of earache in young children.

Children with chronic glue ear are at a heightened risk of **delayed speech and language development**.

## Investigations

**On initial presentation, an otoscopic examination of the ears is conducted:**

- The tympanic membrane may appear normal in cases of OME.
- No signs of inflammation or discharge are typically present.
  
### Indicators of OME:

- Abnormal eardrum color
- Loss of or more diffuse light reflex
- Opacification of the eardrum
- Presence of air bubbles
- Retraction or concavity of the eardrum

Usually, a visual inspection of the ear suffices for diagnosing glue ear; however, **imaging techniques can be employed if symptoms persist beyond `3 months`, typically after referral to a specialist:**

- **Tympanometry**
  - Assess the eardrum's response to sound. (84-93% sensitive and 70-79% specific for diagnosing OME)
  
- **Audiometry**
  - Tailored to the child's developmental stage and is essential for assessing hearing loss.
    - For ages `8 months` to `2.5 years`, **visual response audiometry** is utilized.
    - **Conventional audiometry** is suggested for children older than `4 years`.

Children with conditions like cleft palate or Down Syndrome should be monitored every `3 to 6 months` for OME.

## Management (Prescribing)

- There is no specific medication for glue ear; however, **analgesics** can alleviate ear pain if necessary.
- **Antibiotics** may be prescribed if an ear infection is present.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Glue ear often resolves spontaneously, with a typical time frame of up to `three months`. Patients are usually advised to allow `6-12 weeks` to assess whether the condition resolves naturally while monitoring symptoms. Hearing generally improves as the fluid drains.

**Important Exceptions:**
- Patients with cleft palate or Downâ€™s syndrome should be promptly referred to a specialist.

### Autoinflation by Nasal Balloon

- Can be used during the `6-12 week` observation period for compliant children; *not advised for those under `3 years` of age*.
- This technique involves blowing up a balloon through the nostril `2-3 times a day` to aid fluid drainage by opening the Eustachian tube. 
- Older children may perform a similar maneuver without the balloon using the **Valsalva technique**.
  
> **Caution:** Autoinflation should not be attempted if the child has an upper respiratory infection or experiences pain.

### Hearing Aids

- Hearing aids may be considered for children suffering persistent bilateral OME with hearing loss when surgery is not appropriate.

### Surgery

- **Myringotomy**: Typically involves suctioning the fluid and inserting **grommets** for cases of persistent bilateral OME where hearing levels are below `25-30 dBHL` over `3 months`.
- **Adenoidectomy** may also be indicated.
- Surgery can be assessed even for children with less severe hearing loss if learning difficulties are a concern.
- Grommets are preferred over tympanostomy tubes due to fewer complications; however, potential complications of grommets include infections and tympanosclerosis.
  
> **Post-Surgery Care**: 
  - Patients should plug their ears with cotton wool or petroleum jelly while swimming or showering.
  - Grommets typically extrude on their own within `3 to 12 months`, at which point hearing should be reassessed. Reinsertion of grommets might be required.

### Speech Therapy

- Young children experiencing chronic glue ear may require **speech therapy** due to susceptibility to delayed speech and language development.

  {
    question: "A 5-year-old child is brought to the clinic with a history of trouble hearing and increased volume while speaking. The child has had a cough and runny nose for the past few weeks. Upon otoscopic examination, the tympanic membrane appears retracted with a muffled light reflex. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Acute Otitis Media",
      "Otitis Media with Effusion",
      "Chronic Otitis Media",
      "Eustachian Tube Dysfunction",
      "Earwax Impaction"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The symptoms of dulled hearing combined with the appearance of the retracted tympanic membrane suggest Otitis Media with Effusion (OME). This condition is characterized by fluid accumulation in the middle ear without acute infection, often following respiratory illnesses.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the recent upper respiratory symptoms and the examination findings showing a retracted tympanic membrane. What condition is associated with fluid in the middle ear but without signs of acute inflammation or infection?"
  },
  {
