# Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) describes a disorder characterised by **apnoea** (not breathing for `>10 seconds`) or **hypopnoea** (reduced breathing) caused by a repetitive complete or partial collapse of the upper airway (base of the tongue, soft palate with uvula and epiglottis) during sleep. Apnoeic episodes can last from 20 seconds to 3 minutes and occur 100-160 times per night.

## **Symptoms**

Symptoms of OSA include:

- **Snoring**
- **Snorting**
- **Choking** during sleep
- Awakening in the night as the body attempts to open the airway.

Consequently, patients suffer from:

- **Non-restorative sleep**
- Morning headache
- Daytime somnolence (sleepiness)
- Poor social and work performance

The *Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)* can be used to distinguish sleepiness from fatigue, where a score of `10` or more indicates significant sleepiness.

Other potential symptoms include:

- Mood changes (e.g., anxiety, irritability, depression)
- Sexual dysfunction

In the long run, patients with untreated OSA are at increased risk of:

- Hypertension
- Coronary artery disease (CAD)
- Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA)
- Arrhythmias

**Chronic hypoxaemia** can also result in:

- Pulmonary hypertension
- Right ventricular dysfunction
- Cor pulmonale

Cognitive effects recognised include:

- Memory loss
- Decreased concentration
- Confusion

As a result, safety while driving and at the workplace becomes a significant concern.

## **Risk Factors**

Risk factors for OSA include:

- Obesity (BMI `>28 kg/m²`) – due to upper airway narrowing
- Advanced age – due to decreased muscle tone
- Male gender
- Craniofacial and upper airway abnormalities
- Mechanical obstruction from:
  - Persistent upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), allergies
  - Enlarged tonsils or adenoids – especially in children
  - Nasal tumours
  - Hypothyroidism – due to macroglossia
  - Neuromuscular disease
- Family history of snoring or OSA
- Smoking

### **Associated Medical Conditions**

OSA is associated with certain medical conditions including:

- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
- Pregnancy
- End-stage kidney disease
- Congestive heart failure
- Chronic lung disease
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Stroke
- Acromegaly
- Hypothyroidism
- Polycystic ovary syndrome
- Floppy eyelid syndrome

## **Diagnosis**

Diagnosis of OSA is based on clinical symptoms and the frequency of respiratory events during sleep, as measured by **nocturnal polysomnography**. In an asymptomatic patient, there should be `15` or more apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (i.e., apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of `15` or more per hour). In the presence of the above-mentioned symptoms or consequences, `5` or more apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (i.e., AHI of `5` or more per hour) are needed to diagnose OSA.

**Differential diagnoses** for OSA are based on the presenting complaint and can range from:

- Insufficient sleep
- Sleep disorders
- Neurologic disorders 
- Psychiatric disorders 
- Medications

**Distinctions** are made via clinical history and polysomnography.

>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) does not recommend the use of screening questionnaires to screen for asymptomatic OSA in the community given the low specificity of the questionnaire. However, the use of such instruments, specifically the **STOP-Bang questionnaire**, may be considered in the preoperative evaluation of patients with undiagnosed OSA. 

### **STOP-Bang Questionnaire**

The STOP-Bang questionnaire is an eight-item survey that incorporates information on:

- **S**noring
- **T**iredness
- **O**bserved apneas
- Blood **P**ressure
- **B**ody mass index (BMI)
- **A**ge
- **N**eck circumference
- **G**ender

A score of `3` or higher suggests the diagnosis of OSA.

## **Investigations**

To confirm the diagnosis:

- **Nocturnal polysomnography (PSG)**
  - This is a sleep study that observes brain waves, skeletal muscle activity, blood oxygen levels, heart rate, breathing rate, and eye movement to help identify sleep disorders.
  - This can be done **at home** (home sleep apnoea testing [HSAT]) or **in the laboratory**. In-laboratory PSG proves to be more sensitive in identifying complex or mild sleep-related events.
  - A positive result is described as above (in ‘Diagnosis’).
  - If the initial result is negative, but the suspicion for OSA remains, PSG should be repeated.
  - Other sleep disorders diagnosed may include narcolepsy, sleep-related seizure disorders, periodic limb movement disorder, or restless legs syndrome and chronic insomnia.

To work up for **aetiology or secondary causes**:

- **TSH** if clinically indicated

To determine **associated conditions and complications** from OSA:

- Blood pressure measurement
- Fasting blood sugar

## **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

OSA is a chronic disease that requires long-term, multidisciplinary care.

### **Conservative Management:**

- **Patient education** – including the increased risk of motor vehicle accidents
- **Weight loss**
- **Avoid sleeping supine** – in which the effect can be measured on PSG
- **Avoid alcohol and other sedatives**
- **Avoid smoking**
- **Treat nasal problems**
- **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** – the primary modality of treatment for OSA; maintains airway patency in `95%` of OSA cases.
- **Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)** – for more severe OSA, but more expensive.
- **Dental appliances** – an alternative to CPAP; to be worn during sleep to mechanically open up the airway.

### **Surgical Interventions:**

- **Somnoplasty**
- **Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)**
- **Tonsillectomy**
- **Adenoidectomy** – in children

Surgical therapy is generally indicated in patients that present with surgically correctable mechanical obstruction of the upper airway. It can also be considered in patients who have failed or rejected non-invasive treatment as described above.

## **Management (Prescribing)**

Adjunctive pharmacological therapy can be considered in the treatment of **residual excessive sleepiness (RES)** despite adequate OSA-specific therapy as mentioned above, but its use is controversial.

  {
    question: "A 55-year-old male presents to the clinic with daytime sleepiness and a history of snoring. He has a BMI of 32 kg/m². Which of the following findings on nocturnal polysomnography would be most suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea?",
    options: [
      "Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 4 per hour",
      "AHI of 10 per hour with oxygen desaturation below 90%",
      "Central apnea with minimal respiratory effort",
      "AHI of 20 per hour with predominantly central apneas",
      "AHI of 5 per hour with no desaturations"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 10 or more with significant desaturation, as indicated here (below 90%), strongly suggests obstructive sleep apnea, especially in a patient with risk factors. This finding would generally warrant further evaluation and possible treatment.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about what an AHI measurement indicates and the significance of oxygen desaturation during sleep. In the context of risk factors like obesity, how does the severity of respiratory events correlate with a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 43-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea is advised to initiate non-prescriptive management. Which of the following lifestyle modifications would be most beneficial for managing her condition?",
    options: [
      "Eating more high-carbohydrate meals before bed",
      "Increasing alcohol intake to promote relaxation",
      "Losing weight to improve airway patency",
      "Sleeping in a supine position",
      "Practicing excessive daytime napping"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Weight loss is one of the most significant lifestyle changes that can reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, particularly in individuals who are overweight or obese. This can lead to improved airway patency during sleep.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the common lifestyle changes that impact sleep apnea. Would increasing body weight or adopting a position that leads to airway collapse be helpful in a patient with OSA?"
  },
  {
    question: "In using the STOP-Bang questionnaire for screening obstructive sleep apnea, which of the following scores would raise suspicion for OSA?",
    options: [
      "Score of 1",
