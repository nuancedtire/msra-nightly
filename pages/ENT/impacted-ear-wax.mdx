# Impacted Ear Wax (Cerumen Impaction)

Impacted ear wax, medically termed as **cerumen impaction**, is due to excessive ear wax (cerumen) accumulating in the external auditory canal. This condition can result in variable levels of **conductive hearing difficulties**. Cerumen serves as a naturally occurring product that aids in protecting and lubricating the external auditory canal.

## Diagnosis

Cerumen impaction tends to be more common in the elderly due to factors such as:
- Increased ear hair
- Drier ear wax
- Underlying cognitive impairment
- Insertion of hearing aids (which can push ear wax deeper)

The diagnosis of cerumen impaction is generally straightforward. Patients may complain of:
- Ear fullness
- Hearing loss
  
Other symptoms can include:
- Vertigo
- Tinnitus
- Repeated external ear infections

## Investigations

To diagnose cerumen impaction, the following investigations are typically conducted:
- **Otoscopy**: Direct visualization of the external ear canal using an otoscope.
- **Audiogram**: Conducted after the removal of cerumen to rule out other pathologies. Performing an audiogram before removal may reveal conductive hearing loss.

## Management (Prescribing)

The first-line management for impacted ear wax is the use of **cerumenolytic ear drops**. These drops help soften ear wax, facilitating its natural removal. They can also serve as an adjunct for:
- Aural irrigation
- Manual removal

Common options for ear drops include:
- Olive oil
- Almond oil

> **Contraindication:** Ear drops are not recommended for patients with a history of tympanostomy.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

There are several methods to remove cerumen from the ear canal; the two most commonly used methods are:
1. **Ear irrigation**
   - This involves washing the ear canal using a low-pressure stream of water, typically performed by primary care practitioners.
   
2. **Manual removal**
   - Usually performed by an ENT under direct visualization with a microscope.

Cerumen solvents can be used as an adjunct to help soften ear wax prior to removal. These include:
- Hydrogen peroxide
- Liquid docusate sodium
- Olive oil
- Carbamide peroxide
- Glycerine
- Acetic acid
- Mineral oil
- Triethanolamine

> **Warning:** Repeated use of cerumen solvents is not recommended as it may cause external ear irritation.

### Contraindications for Ear Irrigation

Ear irrigation should be avoided in patients with:
- Previous history of ear-canal stenosis
- Previous ear surgery
- Tympanic membrane perforation
- Repeated external otitis

Patients in these categories should be referred to an ENT surgeon for specialist advice.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old man presents to your clinic with complaints of ear fullness and diminished hearing. He has a history of cognitive impairment and uses hearing aids. Physical examination reveals a large amount of cerumen in the external auditory canal. What is the most appropriate first-line treatment for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Manual removal by an ENT specialist",
      "Cerumenolytic ear drops",
      "Ear irrigation with tap water",
      "Observation and follow-up in one month",
      "Insertion of a cotton ball soaked in vinegar"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The first-line management for this patient is the use of cerumenolytic ear drops, as they help soften the wax for easier removal. Manual removal can be performed, but cerumenolytic drops are typically recommended prior to such interventions, especially when a significant amount of cerumen is present.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider what initial management is most appropriate to soften the ear wax before attempting further invasive procedures. What options are available in the initial management of cerumen impaction?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with a history of repeated external otitis comes into your office with hearing loss and a sensation of ear fullness. After examination, you suspect cerumen impaction. Which of the following treatments is contraindicated in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Cerumenolytic ear drops",
      "Ear irrigation",
      "Manual removal",
      "Observation",
      "Antibiotic ear drops"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Ear irrigation is contraindicated in patients with a history of repeated external otitis as it may exacerbate their condition. In such cases, alternative methods such as cerumenolytic drops or manual removal should be considered instead.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the patient's history and the potential complications associated with various treatment methods for cerumen impaction. What specific conditions would prohibit the use of certain removal techniques?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following ear drops is NOT recommended for use in patients with a history of tympanostomy?",
    options: [
      "Hydrogen peroxide",
      "Almond oil",
      "Carbamide peroxide",
      "Olive oil",
      "Mineral oil"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Ear drops like hydrogen peroxide are contraindicated in patients with a history of tympanostomy due to the risk of damaging the tympanic membrane or causing irritation.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the implications of using cerumenolytic agents in patients with specific historical ear conditions. What is your understanding of tympanic membrane health in relation to ear drop usage?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old woman complains of hearing loss and tinnitus. Otoscopy reveals impacted ear wax. After treating with cerumenolytic ear drops, what should be done next?",
    options: [
      "Immediate ear irrigation to remove the wax",
      "Conduct an audiogram to assess for other issues",
      "Repeat application of cerumenolytic drops after a week",
      "Manual removal by an ENT specialist",
      "Follow-up in one year to reassess"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! After the use of cerumenolytic ear drops, an audiogram is typically conducted to ensure that the hearing loss is due to wax impaction and to rule out other pathologies. Only after that should methods of removal be considered, depending on the results.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the purpose of diagnostic actions following treatment. What is the standard approach for evaluating hearing loss after cerumen impaction treatment?"
