# Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma)

Acoustic neuroma, also known as **vestibular Schwannoma**, is a benign intracranial tumor that arises from the **Schwann cells** of the vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve). Schwann cells produce the myelin sheath that insulates peripheral nerves, improving nerve conduction speed. Schwannomas are tumors arising from these cells. Although the tumors are benign, they can cause significant hearing and balance symptoms, and there is a very small chance of malignant transformation. The tumors are most often unilateral and, if so, are generally sporadic. Bilateral tumors are associated with the hereditary condition **neurofibromatosis type 2**.

## **Diagnosis**

The most common clinical presentation of acoustic neuroma includes:

- **Unilateral hearing loss** (most common)
- **Tinnitus**
- **Vertigo**
- **Unsteadiness**
- **Facial numbness**
- **Facial weakness**

**Headache** may occur but is less common and typically caused by very large tumors. 

**Large tumors** may cause symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, such as:

- Headache
- Vomiting
- Reduced GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale)

**Important note:** These raised intracranial pressure symptoms are generally seen only in advanced disease.

Any patient with suspicious symptoms should have cranial imaging to investigate the possibility of an acoustic neuroma. **Definitive diagnosis** is made with **Gadolinium-enhanced MRI imaging**, which is the gold-standard investigation capable of detecting very small tumors. 

Often, CT imaging and plain MRI are performed prior to Gadolinium use due to their better availability.

## **Investigations**

Alongside CT and MRI imaging mentioned earlier, **audiograms** are used to investigate potential acoustic neuromas. These primarily identify the type of hearing loss experienced by individuals.

Typical findings include:

- High-frequency sensorineural hearing loss
- Associated loss of speech discrimination (patients can hear speech but cannot comprehend it)

**Auditory brainstem response tests** may be conducted before imaging, especially for screening patients at low risk for acoustic neuroma. This test assesses if the electrical impulse of the vestibulocochlear nerve is being disrupted, indicating a possible acoustic neuroma. 

CT or MRI scans are the initial imaging investigations for suspected acoustic neuroma. If a lesion is detected, then a **Gad-enhanced MRI** is performed for definitive diagnosis.

## **Management (Prescribing)**

There are no medications specifically used to treat acoustic neuromas. Management options typically include:

- **Observation**
- **Surgery**
- **Radiotherapy**

## **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

**Conservative management**, or 'watchful waiting,' involves observation and regular monitoring with MRI scans. This option is often chosen for elderly patients or those with multiple comorbidities for whom surgery or radiotherapy may not be appropriate. 

### Supportive measures may include:

- Hearing aids
- Assistance animals
- Devices in the home (as assessed by occupational therapy teams)

### Surgical Management

Surgery can be curative, but full resection of the tumor is often not possible due to involvement with the vestibulocochlear nerve and other brain structures. The surgical aim is often to control the tumor while preserving hearing function, though lost function cannot be restored. 

#### Traditional surgical approaches include:

- Retrosigmoid craniotomy
- Middle fossa craniotomy
- Translabyrinthine craniotomy

**Risks associated with surgery include:**

- Damage to the seventh and eighth cranial nerves (potential facial paralysis and hearing loss)
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks

Since the advent of **microscopic surgery**, this approach is preferred, utilizing microscopy to assist delicate operations.

Regular MRI scans are required to monitor for any regrowth, as complete resection is generally not possible.

**Important note:** If a patient is deaf in the contralateral ear, surgery is not recommended due to the high risk of hearing damage rendering the patient entirely deaf.

### Radiotherapy

Radiotherapy is administered in the form of **highly precise stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)**, which is a type of external beam radiotherapy capable of accurately localizing radiation to specific brain areas. 

- **Administered as a single fraction (dose)**
- SRS does not completely cure tumors but may arrest growth or shrink tumor size.

Monitoring with MRI scans is also required to assess for any tumor regrowth.

  {
    question: "A 60-year-old male presents with unilateral hearing loss and episodes of tinnitus. After cranial imaging is performed, a Gadolinium-enhanced MRI confirms the presence of an acoustic neuroma. Which of the following is the most common initial management strategy for this condition?",
    options: [
      "Stereotactic radiosurgery",
      "Immediate surgical resection",
      "Observation with regular MRI monitoring",
      "Audiological rehabilitation with hearing aids",
      "Chemotherapy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For patients with acoustic neuroma who are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms, 'watchful waiting' with observation and regular MRI monitoring is often the most appropriate initial management strategy. This is particularly true for elderly patients or those with significant comorbidities.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the typical clinical pathway for managing newly diagnosed acoustic neuromas. While surgery and radiation therapy are options, they are not always the first steps, especially when the tumors are small and symptoms are manageable."
  },
  {
    question: "During surgery for an acoustic neuroma, the surgeon is concerned about the risk of injury to the cranial nerves. Which cranial nerve is most at risk during surgical resection of an acoustic neuroma?",
    options: [
      "Cranial Nerve VII (Facial nerve)",
      "Cranial Nerve VIII (Vestibulocochlear nerve)",
      "Cranial Nerve V (Trigeminal nerve)",
      "Cranial Nerve X (Vagus nerve)",
      "Cranial Nerve IX (Glossopharyngeal nerve)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The facial nerve (Cranial Nerve VII) is at significant risk during surgical resection of an acoustic neuroma due to its anatomical proximity to the tumor. Preserving function of this nerve is a critical consideration during surgery.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the anatomy of the cranial nerves and their relationships to the vestibulocochlear nerve. Which nerves would be most affected by surgical intervention in that area? One of the options is particularly relevant to facial movements."

  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma undergoes a follow-up MRI after treatment. If no residual or recurrent tumor is found, what is the most appropriate follow-up care?",
    options: [
      "Annual MRI scans for 5 years, then biannual scans",
      "Immediate repeat surgery",
      "CT scans every 6 months for 2 years",
      "Bi-annual MRI scans indefinitely",
      "No follow-up necessary"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! After treatment of an acoustic neuroma, it is recommended to have annual MRI scans for 5 years to monitor for recurrence, followed by biannual scans thereafter to ensure ongoing surveillance.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the typical follow-up protocols for managing benign tumors like acoustic neuromas. Regular imaging is crucial for detecting any growth or recurrence; what standard timeframe makes sense in this context?"
