# Graves' Disease: Overview, Diagnosis, Management, and Complications

Graves' disease is the most common type of **hyperthyroidism** in iodine-sufficient regions of the world. It is classified under autoimmune thyroid disease and is characterized by the excessive production of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) due to the presence of **TSH receptor antibodies**.

## Diagnosis

The prevalence of Graves' disease in the UK is estimated to be between `0.2%` and `1.3%` of the population, with a higher incidence in middle-aged females aged `30-50`. There is an associated risk of other autoimmune conditions, including:

- **Systemic Lupus Erythromatosus**
- **Sjogrenâ€™s Syndrome**

### Common Signs and Symptoms

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand</summary>

- **Tremor**
- **Irritability**
- **Sweating**
- **Heat intolerance**
- **Unplanned weight loss**
- **Diffuse goitre**
- **Palpitations**
- **Lethargy**
- **Menstrual disturbances** (typically oligomenorrhoea)

</details>

### Physical Signs Associated with Graves' Disease

- **Heat intolerance**
- **Tremor**
- **Tachycardia** or **Arrhythmia**
- **Onycholysis**
- **Acropachy**
- **Goitre**
- **Muscle weakness** (more commonly proximal)
- **Thyroid bruit**
- **Pretibial myxoedema**

Approximately `25%` of patients with Graves' disease develop **Graves' ophthalmopathy**, which may present with:

- Dry eyes
- Photophobia
- Ophthalmoplegia
- Exophthalmos
- Diplopia
- Potential blindness

### Complications of Untreated Graves' Disease

If left untreated, Graves' disease can lead to severe complications, including:

- **Thyroid storm**: A rare but life-threatening condition with symptoms including:
  - Restlessness
  - Agitation
  - Tachycardia/arrhythmia
  - Fever
  - Hypertension
  - Confusion

- **Complications of Graves' ophthalmopathy**: This may culminate in blindness in severe cases.
- **Osteoporosis**

## Investigations

Diagnostic investigations typically include:

1. **Serum TSH**
2. **Serum total or free T3**
3. **Serum total or free T4**

In primary hyperthyroidism, T3 and T4 would be elevated while serum TSH would be low. 

The following tests are recommended to confirm Graves' disease:

- **Serum TSH receptor antibody test (TRAb)**: Typically elevated in Graves' disease.
- If TRAb is normal, **radioactive iodine uptake (I-123)** can be performed, revealing elevated iodine uptake.
- **Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO)** antibodies may be present in `75%` of patients.

*Note*: Thyroid ultrasound is generally not routine unless a nodular goitre or malignancy is suspected.

## Management (Prescribing)

Pharmacological treatment can be categorized into **symptomatic management** and **specialist antithyroid medication**.

### Symptomatic Management

- **First-line**: Beta-blockers.
- If contraindicated, consider calcium channel blockers, primarily **diltiazem** or **verapamil**.
- Aim to taper and discontinue the medication once the patient is asymptomatic and euthyroid.

### Antithyroid Medication

- Initiation requires **specialist advice** according to NICE CKS guidance.
- Two primary medications:
  - **Carbimazole** (first-line in non-pregnant patients)
  - **Propylthiouracil** (recommended for pregnant patients or those trying to conceive within the next `6 months`)
  
*On average*, effect of antithyroid medications takes `6-8 weeks` to observe.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Definitive treatment options for Graves' disease include **thyroid surgery** or **radioactive iodine treatment**.

### Surgical Management

- **Total or near-total thyroidectomy** is preferred to reduce recurrences.
- Patients should be treated with antithyroid medication pre-operatively to achieve **euthyroidism**.
- Post-operative care typically involves **levothyroxine** therapy to manage hypothyroidism.
- Monitor with six-weekly serum T4 and TSH until stable, then annually.

**Complications of surgery** may include:

- Infection
- Bleeding leading to large haematoma
- Airway obstruction
- Hypocalcaemia (if parathyroid glands damaged)
- Vocal cord paralysis (due to recurrent laryngeal nerve damage)

### Radioactive Iodine Treatment

- Considered first-line if antithyroid medication or surgery is ineffective.
- Focuses on destroying thyroid tissue.
- **Important:** It can worsen existing Graves' ophthalmopathy; concurrent corticosteroids may be prescribed for up to `3 months`.
- Post-treatment levothyroxine is often required.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old woman presents to the clinic with symptoms of anxiety, weight loss, and palpitations. Physical examination reveals a diffuse goitre, and laboratory tests show a suppressed TSH level and elevated T3 and T4. Which of the following autoantibodies is most likely elevated in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO)",
      "Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAb)",
      "Thyroglobulin antibodies",
      "Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)",
      "Anti-Ro antibodies"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAb) are typically elevated in Graves' disease, which is consistent with this patient's hyperthyroid state. This autoimmune condition features antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland, leading to overproduction of thyroid hormones. While anti-TPO antibodies may also be present in some patients, TRAb are specifically associated with Graves' disease.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the specific autoimmune markers for hyperthyroidism and which antibodies are specifically associated with Graves' disease. Which one directly interacts with TSH receptors?"
  },
  {
    question: "During follow-up for a patient with untreated Graves' disease, she develops symptoms suggestive of thyroid storm. Which of the following is the most critical immediate intervention in the management of a thyroid storm?",
    options: [
      "Administer high-dose aspirin",
      "Provide intravenous beta-blockers",
      "Start corticosteroids",
      "Initiate radioactive iodine therapy",
      "Administer IV fluids"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The immediate treatment of thyroid storm includes the use of intravenous beta-blockers to control symptoms such as tachycardia and hypertension. While all options listed can be part of the overall management, controlling the sympathetic overactivity is crucial.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the immediate actions needed in a life-threatening condition. Which intervention is aimed specifically at controlling cardiac manifestations and reducing metabolic demands quickly?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with recently diagnosed Graves' disease is started on carbimazole. What is the primary mechanism of action of this drug?",
    options: [
      "Inhibition of TSH release from the pituitary gland",
      "Blocking the synthesis of thyroid hormones by inhibiting thyroid peroxidase",
      "Destruction of thyroid tissue via radioactive effects",
      "Inhibition of the conversion of T4 to T3",
      "Decreasing iodine absorption in the gastrointestinal tract"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Carbimazole acts by inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, which is necessary for the synthesis of thyroid hormones in the thyroid gland. This action decreases the production of T3 and T4, thus helping to control hyperthyroid symptoms.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about how carbimazole works at a cellular level within the thyroid gland. Are you familiar with the role of thyroid peroxidase in hormone synthesis?"
