# Acute Laryngitis

Acute laryngitis is defined as inflammation of the larynx lasting less than `7 days`. The etiology is predominantly infectious, whereas non-infectious causes are more likely to result in chronic laryngitis (lasting `>3 weeks`). 

## **Etiology**

Infectious causes of acute laryngitis include:

- **Virus:** 
  - *Rhinovirus* is the most common infectious agent of acute laryngitis.
  
- **Bacteria:** 
  - *Haemophilus influenzae*
  - *Beta-haemolytic streptococci*
  - Historically, *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* was a significant cause, but its incidence has decreased in developed countries due to the diphtheria vaccine.

- **Fungus:** 
  - *Candida* and *Cryptococcus* (particularly in immunocompromised individuals).

## **Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of acute laryngitis is primarily clinical, relying on history and examination. 

### **Risk Factors:**

- Preceding upper respiratory tract infection 
- Incomplete vaccination history 
- Contact with infected individuals
- Travel to diphtheria-endemic areas
- Immunocompromised status

### **Symptoms:**

- **Hoarseness**
- **Aphonia:** loss of voice
- **Sore throat**
- **Dysphagia:** difficulty swallowing
- **Odynophagia:** painful swallowing
- **Cough:** may be exacerbated by post-nasal drip
- **Fever**
- **Coryza**
- **Malaise:** particularly if diphtheria is implicated
- **Dyspnoea:** especially if laryngeal edema compromises the airway

### **Examination Findings:**

On examination, clinicians may observe:

- A hyperaemic oropharynx
- Enlarged tonsils
- Cervical lymphadenopathy (suggestive of bacterial cause)
- Oropharyngeal white exudates in cases of diphtheria
- Stridor indicating airway compromise
- Signs of respiratory distress

## **Investigations**

Investigations are generally not required for acute viral laryngitis. However, if a bacterial infection is suspected, the following tests may be conducted:

- Swabs of the oropharynx and nose for culture
- Rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcal infection
- Detection of diphtheria toxin production via:
  - Serum immunoprecipitation
  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
  - Immunochromatography

Laryngoscopy may be performed to visualize the larynx, especially in secondary care settings.

## **Management**

### **Prescribing**

Empirical antibiotics should be initiated if bacterial laryngitis is suspected. The choice of antibiotic is guided by local guidelines. Additionally, diphtheria antitoxin is administered to all suspected diphtheria patients.

Corticosteroid use is debated and reserved for non-diphtheria patients experiencing airway compromise due to laryngeal edema. 

Analgesics, mucolytics (to reduce secretion viscosity), and cough suppressants may alleviate symptoms.

### **Non-Prescribing**

The initial step in managing any patient with acute laryngitis is to assess the airway. If there is evidence of current or impending airway compromise (e.g., inability to speak or presence of stridor), immediate hospital admission for airway management is warranted. 

Patients with suspected diphtheria are also at risk of airway compromise and should be admitted to the hospital and isolated.

**Management Tips:**

- **Uncomplicated acute laryngitis** can be treated in the community. 
- Viral laryngitis is typically self-resolving, and patients should be advised to rest their voice and adhere to vocal hygiene, including:
  - Staying well-hydrated
  - Limiting caffeine intake

For bacterial laryngitis, antibiotics should be administered. Referral to secondary care is indicated for cases of suspected diphtheria, fungal infections, or chronic laryngitis.

    question: "A 30-year-old male presents with a 3-day history of hoarseness, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. His symptoms began following a mild upper respiratory infection. On examination, he has a hyperaemic oropharynx. What is the most likely cause of his acute laryngitis?",
    options: [
      "Bacterial infection",
      "Viral infection",

    options: [
      "Start broad-spectrum antibiotics",
      "Perform laryngoscopy",
      "Administer corticosteroids",
      "Secure the airway"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In cases with stridor indicating airway compromise, the immediate priority is to secure the airway to prevent respiratory distress or failure.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the signs of airway compromise in this case. What should always be the priority in such scenarios to ensure patient safety?"
