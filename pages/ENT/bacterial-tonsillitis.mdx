# Bacterial Tonsillitis

## Overview

Bacterial tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils due to bacterial infection, commonly affecting children and young adults during winter months. The primary bacterial cause is **group A streptococci (GAS)**, with rarer causes including:

- **Neisseria gonorrhoeae**
- **Corynebacterium diphtheriae**
- **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**

Recurrent or chronic tonsillitis may arise from **polymicrobial infections**.

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Features

Key clinical features include:

* **Sore throat**
* **Dysphagia** (difficulty swallowing)
* **Fever**
* **Red and swollen pharynx**
* **Tonsillar exudates**
* **Tender and swollen cervical lymph nodes**

In children, additional symptoms may include:

* **Headache**
* **Nausea and vomiting**
* **Abdominal pain**

### Modified Centor Score

The Modified Centor score helps estimate the probability of GAS tonsillitis and guides next steps in management.

| Criteria                                   | Points |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Absence of cough                           | +1     |
| Tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes| +1     |
| Temp `>`38°C                              | +1     |
| Exudate on tonsils                        | +1     |
| Age - 3-14 yrs                            | +1     |
| Age - 15-44 yrs                           | 0      |
| Age - `≥`45 yrs                           | -1     |

**Score Interpretation:**

* **≤ 1:** No further diagnostic testing or antibiotics needed; viral tonsillitis likely.
* **2-3:** Rapid antigen testing and/or throat culture for GAS.
* **≥ 4:** Consider rapid antigen testing, throat culture, and empirical antibiotics.

## Investigations

To confirm bacterial tonsillitis and rule out GAS, investigations based on the Modified Centor score include:

- **Rapid antigen testing** (first-line)
- **Throat swabs for culture** (if rapid testing is negative)
- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** (alternative, not commonly used)

## Management (Prescribing)

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are necessary for confirmed GAS tonsillitis to prevent **acute rheumatic fever**. The first-line treatment is a 10-day course of:

- **Oral penicillin V** (also known as phenoxymethylpenicillin)

For patients allergic to penicillin, consider:

- **Macrolides**
- **Cephalosporins**
- **Clindamycin**

### Analgesia

All patients with pharyngitis should receive analgesics (e.g., **paracetamol** or **ibuprofen**) for symptomatic relief.

**Warning:** Always ensure antibiotic therapy is dispensed responsibly to prevent antibiotic resistance.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 10-year-old boy presents with a sore throat, fever, and difficulty swallowing. On examination, he has red and swollen tonsils with exudates, and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. The Modified Centor score yields a total of 3 points. What is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Prescribe antibiotics without further testing",
      "Order a rapid antigen test for group A streptococcus (GAS)",
      "Conduct a throat culture for streptococcus",
      "Instruct symptomatic treatment with analgesics only",
      "Refer for tonsillectomy evaluation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A Modified Centor score of 3 indicates that rapid antigen testing and/or throat culture for GAS is justified. Initiating empirical antibiotics is acceptable in cases where the probability of GAS is reasonable, especially in the presence of symptoms requiring intervention.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While further testing may seem appropriate, consider the modified scoring system's implications. A score of 3 suggests a significant likelihood of GAS, which generally justifies starting treatment without waiting for confirmatory tests."
  },
  {
    question: "In managing bacterial tonsillitis in a patient with a confirmed penicillin allergy, which antibiotic choice is most appropriate?",
    options: [
      "Phenoxymethylpenicillin",
      "Clarithromycin",
      "Amoxicillin",
      "Cefuroxime",
      "Clindamycin"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Macrolides such as clarithromycin and lincosamides like clindamycin are preferred alternatives for patients allergic to penicillin, making them suitable choices for treating bacterial tonsillitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reconsider which alternative antibiotics are indicated for patients allergic to penicillin. Your answer overlooks optimal choices based on established guidelines for managing infections stemming from confirmed allergies."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a primary goal of antibiotic therapy in confirmed group A streptococcal tonsillitis?",
    options: [
      "To reduce throat pain and discomfort",
      "To prevent acute rheumatic fever",
      "To decrease the duration of symptoms",
      "To enhance recovery time",
      "To eliminate tonsillar hypertrophy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The primary aim of initiating antibiotics in bacterial tonsillitis, particularly with GAS, is to prevent acute rheumatic fever, while also providing symptomatic relief.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Antimicrobial therapy extends beyond symptomatic relief. Consider the complications associated with untreated streptococcal infections, specifically the serious sequelae such as acute rheumatic fever that necessitate intervention."
  },
  {
    question: "In a review of literature regarding antibiotic prescribing patterns for bacterial tonsillitis, which of the following strategies is emphasized to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance?",
    options: [
      "Prescribing antibiotics for all sore throats",
      "Using rapid diagnostic tests before starting antibiotics",
      "Encouraging patients to request antibiotics when seeing a doctor",
      "Limiting symptomatic treatments to viral infections only",
      "Doubling the duration of standard antibiotic courses"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Utilizing rapid diagnostic tests is a key strategy to ensure antibiotics are prescribed only for bacterial infections, thus minimizing unnecessary use and reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on how diagnostic tools can guide appropriate treatment. Consider the implications of over-prescribing and their long-term impact on antibiotic effectiveness and public health."
