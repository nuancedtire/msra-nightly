# Oesophageal Cancer: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

Oesophageal cancer is the **8th most common cancer** and the **6th most common cause of death** worldwide. There are two main types of oesophageal cancer: **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)** and **adenocarcinoma (AC)**. The former is more prevalent, while the latter has been increasing in incidence.

### Types of Oesophageal Cancer

| Type                                | Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)                                  | Adenocarcinoma (AC)                       |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Risk Factors**                    | - Smoking                                                    | - Barrett’s oesophagus                   |
|                                     | - Alcohol consumption                                        | - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) |
|                                     | - HPV infection                                              | - Smoking                                 |
|                                     | - Poor nutritional status                                    | - High body mass index (BMI)             |
| **Pathobiology**                   | - Located at mid-oesophagus                                  | - Located near the oesophagogastric junction |
|                                     | -                                                           | - Endoscopic evidence of Barrett’s oesophagus |
|                                     | -                                                           | - Involvement of celiac and perihepatic lymph nodes |

## Clinical Manifestations

The clinical manifestations of oesophageal cancer vary depending on the stage at which the patient presents.

<details>
<summary>Common Signs and Symptoms</summary>

- **Early Stage**: May be asymptomatic or exhibit mild, non-specific symptoms (e.g., reflux and indigestion).
- **Late Stage**:
  - **Dysphagia**: Progressive difficulty swallowing, more prominent with solid food than liquids.
  - **Weight Loss**: Significant unintentional weight loss.
  - **Regurgitation**: Backflow of undigested food.
  - **Anaemia**: May develop due to chronic blood loss.
  - **Odynophagia**: Painful swallowing, indicating more advanced disease.
  - **Local Complications**: 
    - Hoarseness from vocal cord invasion 
    - Respiratory symptoms from aspiration pneumonia due to tracheo-oesophageal fistula formation.
- **Systemic Symptoms**: 
  - Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy 
  - Symptoms of metastatic disease (to bone, liver, lung, and brain).

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of oesophageal cancer is typically established via endoscopic biopsy. A large mucosal mass seen during endoscopy is often diagnostic. For tumours located near the oesophagogastric junction, they are classified as oesophageal cancer only if their epicentre does not extend more than `2cm` into the proximal stomach.

### Staging

The disease is staged using the **tumour, node, metastasis (TNM)** system to evaluate locoregional and distant metastases. Separate stage groupings exist for SCC and AC due to their differences.

## Investigations

### Goals of Investigations

1. **Confirm the diagnosis**: 
   - Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) with biopsy or brush cytology.
   - Barium swallow: Non-invasive but cannot confirm histology.

2. **Stage the disease**:
   - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for local staging.
     - **T staging**: Assessing depth of wall invasion.
     - **N staging**: Identifying malignant lymph nodes.
   - Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan for distant metastases.
     - **N staging**: Nodes >`10mm` considered metastatic.
   - Whole-body integrated fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for ruling out distant metastases.

3. **Determine complications**:
   - Full blood count (FBC) to monitor for low Hb and high WCC.
   - Urea, electrolytes, creatinine (U/E/Cr) assessing for electrolyte disturbances.
   - Liver function test indicators of nutritional deprivation.
   - Laryngoscopy to assess vocal cord paralysis.

4. **Pre-operative workup**:
   - Group and save, cross-match blood, PT/PTT.
   - CXR, ECG, lung function tests, 2D-echocardiogram.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Management strategies for both SCC and AC mainly involve surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, but the choice is highly dependent on patient and disease factors.

### Treatment Options

- **Surgery**:
  - Eligibility typically involves localized and lower T-staged lesions.
  - Preferred surgical approach includes a tri-incisional method:
    - Initial right posterolateral thoracotomy or thoracoscopic approach.
    - Followed by laparotomy or laparoscopy.
    - Left neck incision.
  - Non-operative management may be suitable for patients with high comorbidity or suboptimal tumour locations.
  - **Endoscopic mucosal resection** may be considered for early cancers.

- **Chemoradiotherapy**:
  - Proven to be as effective as surgery, but has a higher local recurrence rate.
  - Recommended for cervical oesophageal cancer.
  - Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy is advisable.
  - Uses include:
    - Neoadjuvant therapy.
    - Definitive (palliative) for non-surgical candidates.
    - Postoperative adjuvant therapy in selective cases.
  - The optimal type, dose, combination, and schedule have yet to be clearly defined.
