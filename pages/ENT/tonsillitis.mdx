# Tonsillitis: Overview, Diagnosis, and Management

Tonsillitis is an **acute inflammation** of the palatine tonsils, mostly occurring in children and young adults. The infection is often initially of **viral origin**, but can become bacterial in about 50% of cases, with *Streptococcus pyogenes* being the most common pathogen.

## Complications of Acute Tonsillitis

Without effective management, acute tonsillitis can lead to several complications, including:

- **Peritonsillar abscess**
- **Pharyngeal abscess**
- **Pneumonia**
- **Glomerulonephritis**
- **Rheumatic fever**

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms

Common symptoms include:

- **Odynophagia** (painful swallowing)
- **Dysphagia** (difficulty swallowing)
- **Earache** and **headache** (referred pain)
- **Malaise**
- **Fever**

Some children may also present with:

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Febrile convulsions

### Signs

Signs of acute tonsillitis include:

- Enlarged, hyperaemic tonsils, with or without exudate
- Pyrexia (fever)
- **Foetor** (bad breath)
- Erythematous pharynx
- Enlarged cervical lymph nodes

## Investigations

Patients with acute tonsillitis may present similarly to **glandular fever**, which should be excluded via the following tests:

- Full Blood Count (FBC)
- Blood film
- Monospot test

Investigations for acute tonsillitis typically show a significantly raised white cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to glandular fever.

## Management (Prescribing)

The **Centor criteria** should guide the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics for acute tonsillitis. If 3 of the following criteria are positive, there is a 50% chance of Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, which necessitates antibiotic treatment:

- **Tonsillar exudate**
- **Fever**
- **Absence of cough**
- **Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy**

Other indicators for antibiotics include:

- History of rheumatic fever
- Marked systemic upset
- Immunosuppression

A recommended course of treatment consists of:

| Antibiotic                       | Duration      |
|----------------------------------|---------------|
| Erythromycin (if penicillin-allergic) | 7-10 days    |
| Phenoxymethylpenicillin (instead of amoxicillin to prevent rash) | 7-10 days    |

Paracetamol should be administered for analgesia, and patients are encouraged to maintain adequate oral fluid intake.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Patients should be admitted to the hospital if any of the following conditions are present:

- Severe dehydration
- Being systemically unwell
- Concerns regarding a peritonsillar or deep space abscess
- Airway concerns

### Tonsillectomy Indications

Tonsillectomy may be indicated for patients with recurrent disabling tonsillitis infections. However, *watchful waiting* is preferred for children with only recurrent mild sore throats. To qualify for tonsillectomy, patients must meet the following criteria:

- At least **7 episodes** in the last year
- At least **5 episodes** per year in the last 2 years
- At least **3 episodes** per year in the last 3 years
- Episodes must be **disabling** and prevent normal functioning
- Recurrent febrile convulsions secondary to tonsillitis
- **Obstructive sleep apnoea**, stridor, or dysphagia due to enlarged tonsils
- Peritonsillar abscess unresponsive to therapy

**Post-operative care** is critical, as patients will likely experience pain and require adequate analgesia and hydration. The most common complication post-operatively is **bleeding**, which may occur immediately after surgery or secondary to an infection.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 12-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. On examination, his tonsils are enlarged with exudate, and he has tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. According to the Centor criteria, which of the following findings would most significantly increase the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis?",
    options: [
      "Cough",
      "Tonsillar exudate",
      "History of recurrent otitis media",
      "Presence of a rash",
      "Cervical lymphadenopathy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of tonsillar exudate is one of the Centor criteria that, when combined with fever and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, significantly increases the probability of Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus infection. Each positive criterion increases the overall score, aiding in decision-making for antibiotic treatment.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Revisit the Centor criteria, which indicate that certain signs and symptoms are more predictive of streptococcal infection. Which specific finding correlates best with a positive streptococcal screen?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 10-year-old girl is diagnosed with acute tonsillitis and is prescribed phenoxymethylpenicillin for 10 days. She presents again after 3 days of treatment with worsening sore throat, high fever, and difficulty breathing. What is the most likely complication she could be experiencing?",
    options: [
      "Chronic tonsillitis",
      "Peritonsillar abscess",
      "Pneumonia",
      "Lemierre syndrome",
      "Glomerulonephritis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patientâ€™s symptoms, particularly the worsening of throat pain and difficulty breathing, suggest the development of a peritonsillar abscess, a common complication of acute tonsillitis. Early recognition and management are crucial to prevent further complications.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the symptoms the patient is presenting with and how they may relate to potential acute complications of tonsillitis. Think about which complication is characterized by localized pain and systemic symptoms following initial treatment."
  },
  {
    question: "Which group of patients should be considered for tonsillectomy based on the indications provided in the article?",
    options: [
      "A child with 3 episodes of mild sore throat in the past year",
      "An adult with chronic pharyngitis",
      "A teenager with obstructive sleep apnoea due to enlarged tonsils",
      "A patient with recurrent viral upper respiratory infections",
      "A child experiencing Febrile convulsions unrelated to throat infections"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Enlarged tonsils causing obstructive sleep apnoea is one of the clear indications for tonsillectomy, as it can lead to significant health issues beyond mere throat pain.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reflect on the specific criteria for tonsillectomy mentioned in the article. Which patient group has characteristics that suggest clinically significant impairment?"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the most common post-operative complication following a tonsillectomy, and when is it likely to occur?",
    options: [
      "Fever in the first 24 hours",
      "Nausea and vomiting within the first week",
      "Bleeding within the first 24 hours or up to 10 days post-surgery",
      "Infection after two weeks",
      "Pain relief medication not being effective"

    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Post-operative bleeding is the most common complication following tonsillectomy and can occur immediately after surgery or up to 10 days post-operatively, necessitating close monitoring during this period.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the typical timelines for complications after surgery. What is the recognized timeframe for the most prevalent complication associated with tonsillectomy?"
