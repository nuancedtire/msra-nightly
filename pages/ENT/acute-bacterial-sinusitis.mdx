# Acute Bacterial Sinusitis (Rhinosinusitis)

Acute bacterial sinusitis, or rhinosinusitis, is the inflammation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses lasting `less than 4 weeks`. While bacterial infections account for only `0.5 to 2%` of episodes of acute sinusitis, they often occur as secondary infections following a viral episode.

## Common Bacterial Causes

The most common bacterial pathogens involved are:

- **Streptococcus pneumoniae**
- **Haemophilus influenzae**
- **Moraxella catarrhalis**

## Predisposing Factors

### In Children

- **Viral upper respiratory infection**
- **Allergic rhinitis**
- **Anatomic obstruction**
- **Mucosal irritants**
- **Sudden changes in atmospheric pressure**

## Complications

Acute bacterial sinusitis can lead to several complications, including:

- **Extension of inflammation into surrounding areas**, such as:
  - Preseptal (periorbital) and orbital cellulitis
  - Orbital subperiosteal abscess
  - Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis
  - Meningitis
  - Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone
  - Epidural, subdural, or brain abscess

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is primarily clinical and is based on the presence of:

- **Nasal Symptoms**
  - Purulent nasal drainage
  - Nasal obstruction
- **Facial Symptoms**
  - Facial pain/pressure/fullness
  - Maxillary tooth discomfort
- **Systemic Signs**
  - Fever
  - Fatigue
- **Others**
  - Cough
  - Sore throat
  - Hyposmia or anosmia
  - Ear pressure/fullness
  - Headache
  - Halitosis

The persistence of symptoms for `>10 days` without clinical improvement is suggestive of a **bacterial etiology**.

### Differential Diagnosis

Possible conditions to differentiate from acute bacterial sinusitis include:

- **Viral upper respiratory infection**
- **Allergic or non-allergic rhinitis**
- **Nasal foreign body**
- **Enlarged or infected adenoids**
- **Mucosal cyst of the maxillary antrum**
- **Pertussis** – catarrhal stage

## Investigations

In the absence of complications, **confirmatory investigations** are generally not required for acute bacterial sinusitis. However, urgent evaluation via imaging is necessary if there are symptoms or signs indicating spread to the central nervous system or surrounding tissues. Imaging modalities used include:

- **Contrast-enhanced CT** of the orbits, sinuses, and brain
- **MRI** (as an alternative)

Imaging is also advised if structural abnormalities are suspected.

## Management (Prescribing)

Acute bacterial sinusitis may resolve spontaneously, with `70-80%` of immunocompetent patients improving within **two weeks**. Thus, a `10-day trial` of symptomatic management is reasonable.

**Antibiotic therapy** should be initiated only if symptoms persist, worsen, or in young patients. For immunocompromised patients or those with comorbidities, treatment must be individualized.

### Recommended Treatments

- **First-line treatment**: Phenoxymethylpenicillin
- **Alternative for systemic illness/severe symptoms**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate
- **For penicillin allergies**: Doxycycline

The duration of antibiotic therapy is typically `5-7 days`, depending on clinical progression, with many patients showing some response within `7 days`.

If symptoms recur within **2 weeks** after initial treatment, there might be inadequate eradication of the infection.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

In addition to antibiotics, the following options can be used to manage symptoms:

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**
- **Antipyretics**
- **Nasal saline irrigation**
- **Topical decongestants**
- **Mucolytics**

**Note:** Symptomatic management alongside antibiotics may alleviate discomfort while the body fights the infection.

  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a history of persistent nasal congestion, purulent nasal drainage, and facial pain for the last 12 days. She reports a mild fever and has tried over-the-counter antihistamines without relief. Which of the following findings would be most suggestive of a bacterial cause for her symptoms?",
    options: [
      "Recent history of viral upper respiratory infection",
      "Nasal drainage that has a clear or watery consistency",
      "Facial pain that improves with nasal decongestant use",
      "Symptoms persisting without improvement for more than 10 days"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Symptoms persisting for more than 10 days without improvement suggest a bacterial etiology in the context of acute sinusitis. Acute bacterial sinusitis is often characterized by ongoing symptoms beyond the typical duration expected for a viral illness.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider what duration of symptoms usually indicates a bacterial infection versus a viral one. Which option points to a prolonged or atypical progression of symptoms, and what does that imply regarding the potential cause?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 6-year-old child with a recent history of viral upper respiratory infection presents with facial swelling and fever. Upon examination, there is evidence of periorbital edema. Which condition should be high on the differential list as a complication of acute bacterial sinusitis?",
    options: [
      "Viral rhinitis",
      "Orbital cellulitis",
      "Allergic rhinitis",
      "Pharyngitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Orbital cellulitis can occur as a serious complication of acute bacterial sinusitis, especially with evidence of periorbital edema in a child. Immediate evaluation and possibly imaging would be warranted in this scenario.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the signs of potential spread of infection in this case. Which option indicates a more severe consequence of sinusitis? What might you look for in terms of symptoms that would differentiate this from simpler or milder conditions?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient diagnosed with acute bacterial sinusitis is treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Which of the following findings during the follow-up visit would suggest treatment failure and potential need for a different antibiotic?",
    options: [
      "Symptoms persisting after 5 days of treatment",
      "Symptoms that began to improve after 3 days but worsened by day 7",
      "Missed doses of the prescribed antibiotic",
      "Total resolution of symptoms by day 6"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Persistent symptoms after 5-7 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy in acute bacterial sinusitis suggest treatment failure and the potential need for a change in antibiotic approach.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider how long it takes for antibiotics to begin showing efficacy in cases of bacterial infections. Look for what constitutes 'treatment failure' in this scenario and how to differentiate between a failed treatment versus an expected course of recovery."
