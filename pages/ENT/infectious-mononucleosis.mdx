# Infectious Mononucleosis

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as **glandular fever** and **kissing disease**, is a syndrome caused by **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)** infection (Herpesvirus type 4). It is characterized by a triad of **fever**, **lymphadenopathy**, and **pharyngitis**. If the aetiological organism is non-EBV, it is referred to as *mononucleosis syndrome*. Other known infecting organisms include **herpes virus 6**, **CMV**, and **HSV-1**. Viral particles are typically transmitted via bodily fluid secretions such as kissing, blood transfusion, and sexual intercourse.

## Diagnosis

The **annual incidence rate** of infectious mononucleosis is estimated to be *50 to 100 cases per 100,000 population*, peaking in the age group of **15 to 19 years**. The incubation period ranges from `30 to 50 days`. 

### Symptoms

The classical symptoms of infectious mononucleosis include:
- **Fever**
- **Lymphadenopathy**
- **Pharyngitis**

Other symptoms may encompass:
- **Fatigue**
- **Splenomegaly**
- **Myalgia**
- **Bleeding**
- **Rashes**

Most cases in children are *asymptomatic*. 

### Physical Signs

Physical signs indicate:
- **Hepatosplenomegaly**
- **Jaundice**
- **Maculopapular rash**
- **Palatal petechiae**
- **Bruising**
- **Periorbital edema**

In severe cases, **upper airway obstruction** may occur due to enlarged tonsils and oropharyngeal lymph nodes.

### Complications

Complications of infectious mononucleosis are well-documented and include:
- **Malignancies**
  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
  - Burkitt’s lymphoma
  - Lymphoproliferative disorders
  - Hodgkin’s lymphoma
- **Splenic rupture**
- **Interstitial nephritis**
- **Encephalitis**

## Investigations

Specific blood tests can be performed to diagnose infectious mononucleosis by detecting serum antibodies against EBV.

### Common Tests

The most commonly used tests include:
1. **Monospot test** (Heterophile antibodies) - Positive in infectious mononucleosis, but false negatives can occur in patients with:
   - CMV infection
   - Lymphoma
   - Rubella
   - HIV-associated acute retroviral syndrome
   - Underlying autoimmune disorders
  
2. **EBV-specific antibody test** - Provides high sensitivity and specificity for EBV infections and helps discern between acute and past infection.

3. **Full blood count** - Typically shows increased white blood cells and anemia; in some cases, patients may develop infectious mononucleosis-induced thrombocytopenia.

### Imaging

Consider performing **abdominal ultrasound** or **CT abdomen** if splenic rupture is evident or suspected.

## Management (Prescribing)

Since infectious mononucleosis is usually *self-limiting*, supportive treatment is the primary approach, which includes:
- **Bed rest**
- **Analgesics**
- **Antipyretics**
- **Hydration**
- Avoidance of *strenuous physical activities*

Currently, there are no antiviral treatments recommended for infectious mononucleosis. *Hospital admission* is usually not required.

### Specific Treatments

- **Upper airway obstruction**: May benefit from corticosteroids in conjunction with airway protection measures such as tracheostomy or intubation.
  
- **Infectious mononucleosis-induced thrombocytopenia**: 
  - May benefit from **IV immunoglobulin therapy**, especially if there is active bleeding. 
  - If bleeding is not present but thrombocytopenia is evident, corticosteroids can be given.

### Activity Restrictions

Patients are advised to avoid contact sports or strenuous physical exercise for up to `8 weeks` due to the risk of splenic rupture.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 17-year-old student presents to the clinic with a fever, severe sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes for the past week. Physical examination reveals palatal petechiae and splenomegaly. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",
    options: [
      "Cytomegalovirus (CMV)",
      "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)",
      "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)",
      "Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)",
      "Bacterial pharyngitis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient exhibits classic symptoms of infectious mononucleosis, which is predominantly caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). The presence of fever, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and palatal petechiae are characteristic features of EBV infection.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the typical causes of mononucleosis-like symptoms. While CMV and HIV can cause similar symptoms, the classic triad and specific findings point towards EBV as the most likely cause. Review the key characteristics of the viruses involved in such presentations."
  },
  {
    question: "A 19-year-old male presents with symptoms consistent with infectious mononucleosis. His Monospot test returns positive. Which of the following conditions could lead to a false negative result on this test?",
    options: [
      "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia",
      "Acute HIV infection",
      "Cytomegalovirus infection",
      "Recent vaccination for EBV",
      "Splenomegaly due to non-EBV causes"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is known to potentially yield false negative results on the Monospot test. Understanding the limitations of diagnostic tests is crucial in clinical scenarios.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Recall the potential causes of false negatives in the Monospot test. Think about viral infections that have overlapping clinical presentations with infectious mononucleosis. CMV is particularly notable in this context."

      "Playing video games",
      "Engaging in light aerobic exercise",
      "Going to school",
      "Using public transportation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Patients diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis should avoid contact sports and strenuous physical activities for at least 8 weeks due to the increased risk of splenic rupture.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the risks associated with certain activities following a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. Identify which activities pose a greater risk of complications, especially concerning the spleen."
  },
  {
    question: "A 20-year-old male presents with infectious mononucleosis. He is experiencing significant fatigue. Which of the following supportive treatments is recommended for managing his condition?",
