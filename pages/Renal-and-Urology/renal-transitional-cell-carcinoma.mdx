# Renal Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC): Overview and Management

## Introduction

Renal transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is a malignant tumor derived from the transitional (urothelial) epithelial cells lining the renal pelvis and ureter. Representing 5-10% of primary renal malignant pelvic tumors, TCC is relatively rare, especially when compared to renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The peak incidence occurs between the ages of 60 and 70, with males being more frequently affected than females at a ratio of 4:1. Metastasis often occurs in the lungs, liver, and bone. Tumor stage, as determined by the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) system, stands out as the most crucial prognostic factor. A majority of renal pelvis TCCs are low grade, with a 5-year survival rate exceeding 90%.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing TCC typically begins with identifying common symptoms:

- **Painless Gross Hematuria:** Present in 75-95% of patients.
- **Urinary Symptoms:** Includes dysuria, frequency, and urgency.
- **Flank Pain and Renal Colic:** Particularly if the tumor is located at the pelvic-ureteric junction.
- **Rare Clinical Triad:** Hematuria, loin pain, and a loin mass, found in about 15% of patients.
- **Symptoms of Metastasis:**
  - Cough with blood (haemoptysis).
  - Bone fractures without a clear cause (pathological fracture).
  - Persistent back pain.
  - Systemic symptoms like fatigue, malaise, and weight loss.

### Risk Factors

- **Smoking:** The most significant risk factor for TCC.
- **Exposure to Carcinogens:** Including aniline dyes, chemicals used in producing leather, textiles, plastics, rubber, and working in the petroleum industry, as well as potential exposure to coal, coke, tar, and asphalt.

### TNM Staging

- **Primary Tumor (T):**
  - `TX`: Primary tumor cannot be assessed.
  - `T0`: No evidence of primary tumor.
  - `Ta`: Papillary non-invasive carcinoma.
  - `Tis`: Carcinoma in situ.
  - `T1`: Carcinoma involves subepithelial connective tissue.
  - `T2`: Carcinoma invades the muscularis.
  - `T3`: Carcinoma invades beyond muscularis into surrounding fat or renal parenchyma.
  - `T4`: Carcinoma invades adjacent organs or extends into perinephric fat.

- **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**
  - `NX`: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.
  - `N0`: No regional lymph node metastasis.
  - `N1`: Metastasis in a single lymph node `â‰¤2 cm` in greatest dimension.
  - `N2`: Metastasis in a lymph node `2-5 cm` in dimension, or multiple nodes, none `>5 cm`.
  - `N3`: Metastasis in a lymph node `>5 cm` in dimension.

- **Distant Metastasis (M):**
  - `MX`: Presence of distant metastasis cannot be assessed.
  - `M0`: No distant metastasis.
  - `M1`: Distant metastasis.

### Survival Rates Post-Radical Surgery

- Stages `Tis`, `Ta`, or `T1`: 91%.
- Stage `T2`: 43%.
- Stages `T3`, `T4`, `N1`, or `N2`: 23%.
- Stages `N3` or `M1`: 0%.

## Investigations

Primary care investigations for suspected renal TCC include:

- **Full Blood Count (FBC):** May indicate iron deficiency from haematuria, or polycythaemia if the renal tumor produces erythropoietin (EPO).
- **Renal Function Tests:** High blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine may be present, but typically normal if the contralateral kidney functions properly.
- **Urine Microscopy and Culture:** Persistent microscopic haematuria (`>2-5 RBCs/high power field`) warrants further investigation, excluding urinary tract infection (UTI).

Advanced diagnostic tools include:

- **Urine Cytology:** Examining urine cells under a microscope for abnormalities.
- **Histology via Ureteroscopy:** Inserting a tube-like instrument to obtain tissue samples for biopsy, and potentially localizing the bleeding site or confirming bladder lesions.
- **CT Scans:** Differentiating between radiolucent renal stones and tumors, with higher Hounsfield units (HU) indicating stones, and 60-80 HU suggesting tumors. Also used for staging and assessing metastasis.
- **CT Urography:** Preferred imaging for identifying filling defects and hydronephrosis, replacing intravenous (IV) urography.
- **Ultrasound KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder):** Used when CT is contraindicated.

Investigating metastasis may involve:

- CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
- Chest X-ray to detect pulmonary metastases.
- Bone scan or skeletal survey.
- Positron emission tomography (PET) scan, detecting increased glucose uptake by active malignant cells.

## Management

### Prescribing

- **First-Line Chemotherapy:** Combines methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, or gemcitabine.
- **Immunotherapy:** Pembrolizumab for metastatic TCC after chemotherapy failure.
- **Intravesical Therapy:** Bacille Calmette-Guerin and/or mitomycin-C administered via a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter.
- **Palliative Chemotherapy:** For systemic management of metastatic disease, with the option of palliative surgery to remove urethral obstructions.

### Non-Prescribing

- **Endoscopic Surgery:** When possible, for localized TCC.
- **Radical Nephroureterectomy:** Removal of the kidney, ureter, and bladder cuff for multifocal TCC.
- **Partial Nephrectomy or Segmental Resection:** For localized cancer in the renal pelvis to preserve kidney function.
- **Segmental Resection of the Ureter:** With anastomosis for superficial cancer in the distal ureter.
- **Lymphadenectomy and Adjuvant Chemotherapy:** For high-grade cancers with positive lymph nodes.

### Follow-Up

- **Routine Checks:** Include urine cytology, liver and renal function tests, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest X-ray.
- **Frequency:** Every 6 months for the first 3 years, then annually until year 5.
