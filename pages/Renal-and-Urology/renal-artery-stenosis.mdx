# Renal Artery Stenosis: An Overview

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a condition characterized by the narrowing of one or both renal arteries, leading to restricted blood flow to the kidneys. It is regarded as significant when there is more than a 50% reduction in vessel diameter and severe when the reduction exceeds 70%.

## Etiology and Risk Factors

The predominant cause of RAS is **atherosclerotic disease**, responsible for about 90% of cases. Key risk factors associated with atherosclerosis include:

- Smoking
- Diabetes mellitus
- Dyslipidemia

Nonatherosclerotic RAS, while less common, is often due to **fibromuscular dysplasia**, particularly in younger, healthier individuals, typically before age 30. Other infrequent causes include neurofibromatosis, trauma, renal artery aneurysm, and thromboembolism.

## Pathophysiology

The constriction of renal arteries leads to renal ischemia. This condition triggers the release of renin from the kidneys' juxtaglomerular cells, escalating levels of angiotensin II, which promotes vasoconstriction, and aldosterone, leading to increased sodium and water retention. These hormonal changes contribute to elevated blood pressure.

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms and Clinical Presentation

Most individuals with RAS are asymptomatic, and the condition is usually discovered incidentally. However, RAS is a well-recognized cause of secondary hypertension. Some patients may present with:

- Accelerated or treatment-resistant hypertension
- Abdominal bruit upon physical examination
- Symptoms related to fluid overload, such as peripheral edema or flash pulmonary edema

### Diagnostic Investigations

For patients with suspected RAS, initial laboratory tests should include:

- Urea and electrolyte levels, with a focus on creatinine and potassium
- Aldosterone-to-renin ratio to rule out primary aldosteronism

Imaging studies are essential for evaluating the extent of stenosis:

- **Duplex Ultrasound:** Visualizes kidney size, renal arteries, and flow metrics
- **MR or CT Angiography:** Outlines renal vascular anatomy, but involves contrast media with associated nephrotoxicity risk
- **Conventional Angiography:** Most sensitive for anatomical assessment and allows for simultaneous therapeutic intervention, albeit invasive and requiring arterial catheterization

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Interventions

The goal of treatment is to halt renal function decline and address fluid retention. Since cardiovascular disease is the leading mortality cause in RAS patients, cardiovascular risk factor modification is critical. The management plan should include:

- Statin therapy to manage cholesterol levels
- Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin to minimize thrombosis risk
- Antihypertensive medications following stepwise guidelines, with ACE inhibitors as a typical first choice but monitored for renal perfusion impact

**Caution:** ACE inhibitors can lead to acute kidney injury in severe RAS cases due to reduced renal perfusion.

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

Lifestyle changes are imperative in managing RAS:

- Weight reduction
- Low-salt diet
- Smoking cessation

For severe cases, revascularization procedures may be recommended to prevent artery occlusion, involving:

- Transluminal balloon angioplasty
- Percutaneous renal artery stenting
- Renal artery reconstruction (commonly in conjunction with other major aortic surgeries)
