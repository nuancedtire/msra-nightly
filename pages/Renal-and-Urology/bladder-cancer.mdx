# Bladder Cancer Overview

Bladder cancer represents a form of malignancy primarily affecting the urothelium, a type of tissue lining various sections of the urinary tract. While it can occur from the renal pelvis to the bladder, its predominant site is within the bladder itself.

## Types of Bladder Cancer

Bladder cancer is categorized into two principal types:

- **Transitional Cell Carcinoma**: This is the most prevalent form of bladder cancer.
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Typically more common in the urethra.

## Risk Factors

Several factors can increase the likelihood of developing bladder cancer:

- Being male.
- Being over the age of 65.
- Tobacco smoking.
- Exposure to specific carcinogens, such as benzidine and aniline dyes.
- Infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type 16.
- Persistent urinary tract inflammation.
- Iatrogenic factors like pelvic irradiation and use of cyclophosphamide.
- Infection with *Schistosoma haematobium* heightens the risk for squamous cell carcinoma.

## Diagnosis

### Signs and Symptoms

Bladder cancer may manifest through various signs and symptoms, which include:

- Painless gross hematuria.
- Dysuria or painful urination.
- Increased urinary frequency.
- Suprapubic, perineal, or rectal pain.
- A palpable mass above the pubic bone.

### Advanced Disease Indicators

More severe stages of the disease might present with:

- Uremic symptoms.
- Indications of metastasis, such as bone pain, shortness of breath, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and swollen lymph nodes.
- Constitutional symptoms like unintentional weight loss, persistent fatigue, and loss of appetite.

## Investigations

A thorough evaluation is essential for diagnosis, involving:

- Urinalysis.
- Full Blood Count (FBC).
- Renal function tests and coagulation profile.
- Imaging studies and tissue biopsy.

All patients presenting with gross hematuria or those over 35 with micro-hematuria should undergo CT urography and cystoscopy. Imaging findings may include:

- Thickening of the bladder wall.
- Hydronephrosis.
- Presence of pedunculated tumors.
- Erythematous lesions within the bladder.

For complete cancer staging, the following should be performed:

- Chest X-ray.
- CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis.
- Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) levels and bone scans to check for metastasis.
- Liver function tests.

## Management

### Prescribing Interventions

The management of bladder cancer integrates chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical resection. Palliative care options include surgery and chemotherapy aimed at symptom relief.

For non-muscle invasive tumors, intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin or gemcitabine is typically administered within 24 hours post-tumor resection, mitigating the risk of tumor cell re-implantation in the bladder wall. An alternative to chemotherapy is intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG). Regular cystoscopies are recommended every 3 months for several years to monitor disease progression.

In cases where the tumor has penetrated the muscle layer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is often prescribed to decrease tumor size before any surgical procedure.

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

<Callout emoji="üî™">
**Surgical Approach:** For tumors confined to the bladder lining, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) is the standard procedure. Muscle-invasive tumors necessitate a radical cystectomy with subsequent creation of a new bladder (neobladder) or urinary diversion.

Prognostically, the 5-year survival rate for non-invasive bladder cancer stands at 90-95%. However, this rate plummets to 12% for individuals with metastatic disease.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 72-year-old male smoker presents with painless gross hematuria. He has no prior history of urinary tract infections or urolithiasis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Acute cystitis",
      "Urolithiasis",
      "Benign prostatic hyperplasia",
      "Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder",
      "Renal cell carcinoma"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The most common presentation of bladder cancer is painless gross hematuria and the most prevalent type in smokers is transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Although the other conditions can present with hematuria, consider the patient's age, smoking history, and the typical presentation of bladder cancer."
  },
  {
    question: "A 65-year-old female with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections presents with dysuria and increased urinary frequency. She has a 10-year history of smoking. A CT urogram shows thickening of the bladder wall and hydronephrosis. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    options: [
      "Start empirical antibiotics for urinary tract infection",
      "Perform a cystoscopy with biopsy",
      "Prescribe alpha-blockers for suspected benign prostatic hyperplasia",
      "Schedule for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for suspected urolithiasis",
      "Immediate radical cystectomy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Given the patient's risk factors for bladder cancer (age, smoking history, and recurrent UTIs), the presence of bladder wall thickening and hydronephrosis on imaging, a cystoscopy with biopsy is the appropriate next step to evaluate for bladder cancer.",
    incorrectFeedback: "While UTI symptoms are present, consider the patient's risk factors and imaging findings that are suggestive of a possible malignancy."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following intravesical therapies is most appropriate for a patient with a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer immediately after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT)?",
    options: [
      "Intravesical mitomycin",
      "Systemic gemcitabine",
      "Intravesical BCG once every six months",
      "Oral cyclophosphamide",
      "Intravenous cisplatin"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Intravesical mitomycin is often administered within 24 hours after TURBT to reduce the risk of tumor cell re-implantation in the bladder wall for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the standard of care for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and the timing of intravesical therapy post-TURBT."
  },
  {
    question: "A 70-year-old man with a newly diagnosed muscle-invasive bladder cancer is being considered for radical cystectomy. Pre-operative evaluation should include all of the following EXCEPT:",
    options: [
      "Full Blood Count (FBC)",
      "Chest X-ray",
      "Liver function tests",
      "Intravenous pyelogram",
      "Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) levels"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! An intravenous pyelogram is not typically included in the pre-operative evaluation for radical cystectomy in bladder cancer patients. Instead, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, chest X-ray, liver function tests, and ALP levels for metastasis check are performed.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which diagnostic tests are essential for staging and pre-operative evaluation of muscle-invasive bladder cancer."
