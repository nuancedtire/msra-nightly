# Understanding Testicular Cancer

Testicular cancer, though a rare entity accounting for merely 1% of all malignancies in males, stands as the most prevalent solid cancer among men aged 15 to 35. It boasts a five-year survival rate upwards of 95%, marking it as one of the most treatable solid neoplasms.

## Types of Testicular Cancer

Testicular cancers fall into two primary groups:

- **Germ Cell Tumours (GCTs)**: These constitute the majority, making up about 95% of testicular cancers.
- **Non-Germ Cell Tumours (NGCTs)**: A smaller category that includes Leydig and Sertoli cell tumours.

For clinical management, GCTs are further classified into:

- Pure seminoma
- Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCTs) such as teratomas, embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas, and yolk sac tumours.

## Diagnosis of Testicular Cancer

### Symptoms

Patients may present with various symptoms, including:

- A painless lump or swelling in the testicle
- Heaviness in the scrotum
- Discomfort or pain in the testicle
- Gynaecomastia, which is the development of breast tissue in males
- Metastatic symptoms depending on the tumour type, such as back pain, cough, dyspnoea, or oedema in the lower limbs

### Physical Examination

During examination, a malignant testis often appears firmer than a non-affected testis and less sensitive than one inflamed due to other conditions.

### Differential Diagnosis

It's important to note that many signs and symptoms of testicular cancer could be attributed to non-cancerous conditions such as:

- Epididymo-orchitis
- Torsion
- Hydrocele
- Haematocele
- Epididymal cyst
- Infection

Lymphoma is also considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Risk Factors

Several risk factors increase the likelihood of testicular cancer:

- Cryptorchidism (undescended testicles)
- A family history of testicular cancer
- HIV infection
- Male infertility
- A previous diagnosis of testicular cancer
- Congenital conditions like Klinefelter’s syndrome
- Other factors such as low birthweight, young parental age, multiparity, breech delivery, and tall stature

A significant genetic component is evident, as nearly all tumours exhibit abnormalities on chromosome 12, and carriers of the TGCT1 gene are at a substantially increased risk.

## Investigations

To diagnose testicular cancer, clinicians employ:

- **Tumour Markers**: These include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
- **Imaging**: A bilateral testicular ultrasound scan (ULS), chest X-ray (CXR), and CT scans focused on abdominal lymph nodes and potential lung metastases
- **Histology**: Biopsy taken during orchiectomy used for staging

**Important:** A bilateral testicular ULS typically confirms the diagnosis, and the Royal Marsden staging system classifies the extent of the disease.

## Management of Testicular Cancer

### Surgical Intervention

Radical orchidectomy remains the cornerstone of treatment. In cases where fertility preservation is a concern, sperm storage and the option of a testicular prosthesis are offered to patients.

### Prescribing Management

- **Stage I Seminoma**: Surveillance, single-dose adjuvant carboplatin, or adjuvant radiotherapy
- **Metastatic Disease**: Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy post-radical orchidectomy
- **Advanced Seminoma**: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy for stages III and IV

### Non-Prescribing Management

For stage I NSGCTs, two courses of adjuvant bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy are recommended following inguinal orchidectomy.

**Warning:** Carcinoma in situ (CIS) in the contralateral testis warrants preventive measures due to a high risk of future malignancy.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 30-year-old male presents with a painless lump on his right testicle. An ultrasound confirms a solid mass within the testicle. Serum tumor markers are ordered and reveal elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Pure seminoma",
      "Non-seminomatous germ cell tumour (NSGCT)",
      "Leydig cell tumour",
      "Epididymal cyst",
      "Hydrocele"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are indicative of a non-seminomatous germ cell tumour (NSGCT), as pure seminomas typically do not elevate AFP.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the tumor markers that are elevated and remember which types of testicular cancers are associated with increases in these markers."
  },
  {
    question: "A 25-year-old male with a history of cryptorchidism that was corrected surgically at the age of 3 is diagnosed with testicular cancer. Given the history of cryptorchidism, which risk factor for testicular cancer is most relevant to this patient?",
    options: [
      "Male infertility",
      "HIV infection",
      "Family history of testicular cancer",
      "Previous diagnosis of testicular cancer",
      "Congenital conditions like Klinefelter’s syndrome"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Cryptorchidism, or undescended testicles, is a significant risk factor for developing testicular cancer and is highly relevant to this patient's history.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Reassess the patient's history for any condition that is known to be a significant risk factor for the development of testicular cancer."
  },
  {
    question: "A 20-year-old man presents with gynecomastia and a firm, painless testicular mass. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A bilateral testicular ultrasound scan is the appropriate next step to evaluate a firm, painless testicular mass, which could indicate testicular cancer.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the most appropriate imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis of a testicular mass suspected to be malignant."
