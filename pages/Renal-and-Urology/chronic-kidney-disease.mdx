# Understanding Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition characterized by persistent kidney function abnormalities or structural damage with potential health consequences. It is usually a progressive disorder, but not all cases lead to a decline in kidney function over time.

## Diagnosis of CKD

The likelihood of a CKD diagnosis increases in individuals with known risk factors. The primary causes include diabetes and hypertension, but CKD can also arise from:

- Glomerular disease, like glomerulonephritis
- Nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides
- Systemic disorders including myeloma and systemic lupus erythematosus
- Obstructive uropathy from structural disease or urinary tract stones

Early-stage CKD often presents with no symptoms. As the disease progresses, patients may experience:

- Uraemic foetor – a urine-like breath odor due to ammonia in saliva
- Cachexia – severe weight loss and muscle wasting
- Pruritis – itchy skin from urea buildup
- Restless legs
- Swelling around the eyes and limbs (periorbital and peripheral oedema)
- Nausea and vomiting

Anaemia-related symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and palpitations are also common since CKD impairs the kidneys' ability to produce erythropoietin, a hormone that prompts red blood cell production.

### Investigations for CKD

Initial tests include blood and urine analyses, along with imaging.

- Blood tests check serum creatinine, eGFR, and electrolytes. Serum creatinine levels are typically elevated in CKD patients, though low muscle mass or age can lead to inaccurately low readings.
  
- The eGFR, calculated via formulas like Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD, confirms CKD diagnosis when below `60ml/min/1.73m²` for over three months. Electrolyte imbalances can point to CKD's root causes, and metabolic acidosis is a hallmark of advanced disease.

- Urinalysis screens for kidney damage indicators. Patients might notice frothy urine (proteinuria) or cola-colored urine (haematuria) as kidney function declines.

CKD classification necessitates measuring urinary albumin and the urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR). A higher ACR signifies more severe disease. ACR and eGFR together help stage CKD and assess the risk of negative outcomes.

## Management of CKD

### Prescribing Interventions

Addressing cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in CKD patients, is crucial. This involves:

- Blood pressure control through antihypertensives
- Blood glucose regulation in diabetic patients
- Lipid management, often with daily statins for cardiovascular protection
- ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to slow CKD progression and delay renal replacement therapy

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

CKD can lead to complications like anaemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and metabolic acidosis. Treatment approaches include:

- Using recombinant human erythropoiesis-stimulating agents like darbepoetin-α to treat anaemia by boosting red blood cell production

- Addressing renal mineral and bone disorder—a collective term for osteoporosis, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and osteomalacia with CKD—using phosphate binders and vitamin D analogues to manage serum phosphate and vitamin D levels

End-stage kidney disease (stage 5) requires renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis or a kidney transplant. Dialysis removes waste and normalizes electrolytes, with haemodialysis necessitating hospital visits and peritoneal dialysis being home-based. Transplants offer a survival advantage but are less available, leaving many on dialysis while awaiting a suitable donor.
