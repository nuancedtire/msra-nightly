# Hypertensive Nephropathy: Understanding, Diagnosis, and Management

Hypertensive nephropathy, a condition characterized by kidney damage resulting from chronic high blood pressure, leads to hardening of the kidneys known as nephrosclerosis. This condition, which primarily affects the kidney's pre-glomerular vasculature, can manifest in either benign or malignant forms. If left unchecked, it can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or even end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Mitigating the progression of hypertensive nephropathy necessitates effective blood pressure management to preserve kidney function and prevent further damage.

## Diagnosis

Hypertensive nephropathy's impact on the prevalence of CKD and ESRD remains uncertain, though it is known that CKD affects women slightly more than men and hypertension is more prevalent in men. Symptoms indicative of hypertensive nephropathy include:

- Loss of appetite
- Itching
- Somnolence or confusion
- Weight loss
- Nausea and vomiting
- Metallic taste in the mouth

Diagnosis hinges on the evidence of persistent chronic hypertension coupled with progressive kidney impairment. Elevated urine albumin levels, or albuminuria, signify glomerular injury, while a 24-hour urine collection measures proteinuria to gauge the extent of kidney disease. Differential diagnoses, such as bilateral renal artery sclerosis, should be considered. Histopathological examination is critical to confirm the diagnosis.

## Investigations

- Perform a blood pressure test to check for hypertension.
- Examine blood samples for anemia (normocytic, normochromic), abnormal electrolytes, and renal function markers such as GFR.
- Analyze urine samples for albuminuria.
- Collect urine for 24 hours to detect proteinuria.
- Conduct a pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.
- Use ultrasound imaging to evaluate kidney size, shape, and function.
- Obtain a kidney biopsy when indicated.

The albumin-to-creatinine ratio is a useful marker for kidney disease secondary to chronic hypertension.

## Management (Prescribing)

The cornerstone of treatment is antihypertensive therapy aimed at achieving a blood pressure of `<130/80`. Medications such as loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs are commonly prescribed. However, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concurrently. In cases of significant kidney damage, ARBs may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, necessitating a switch to loop diuretics like Furosemide. It is important to note that these drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy. With appropriate medication, patients with benign nephrosclerosis can maintain renal function for extended periods. Treatment choices should align with local guidelines.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- Encourage patients with CKD to stay hydrated by drinking several liters of water daily, while carefully managing salt intake to prevent dehydration.
- In ESRD, limit water intake and consider dialysis as treatment.
- A low-protein diet can alleviate uremic symptoms; dietary plans should be developed with a dietitian.
- In acute malignant nephrosclerosis, aggressively reduce blood pressure with intravenous medications such as Furosemide or thiazide diuretics.
