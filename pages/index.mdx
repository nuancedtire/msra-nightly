# Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to a continuum of disease in which there is acute ischaemia or infarction of the myocardium. There are three types:
  - **Unstable angina (UA)**: Evidence of myocardial damage (e.g. chest pain at rest) in the absence of changes to cardiac biomarkers.
  - **Non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)**: Evidence of myocardial damage with elevated cardiac biomarkers but no ST elevation on ECG. It represents a partial-thickness infarct.
  - **ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**: Evidence of myocardial damage with elevated cardiac biomarkers and persistent ST elevation on ECG. It represents a full-thickness infarct.

## Risk Factors

### Modifiable
  - Smoking
  - Type 2 diabetes
  - Hypertension
  - Hypercholesterolaemia
  - Obesity
  - Sedentary lifestyle
  - Cocaine use

### Non-modifiable
  - Increasing age
  - Male gender
  - Family history

## Clinical Presentation

Common symptoms include:
  - Central or left-sided "crushing" chest pain which may radiate to jaw or left arm
  - Shortness of breath
  - Sweating
  - Nausea & Vomiting

*Note: Atypical presentations (e.g. dyspepsia, absence of chest pain) may occur in females, diabetics or the elderly.*

## Investigations

### Bedside
  - Basic observations
  - Serial ECGs
    - STEMI: ST-elevation in certain leads depending on area of infarction
    - NSTEMI or UA: T-wave inversion or ST-depression

### Heart Territory and ECG Changes

| Territory | Coronary Artery | ECG Leads |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Lateral | Left circumflex | I, aVL, V5, V6 |
| Anteroseptal | Left anterior descending | V1 â€“ V4 |
| Inferior | Posterior descending* | II, III, aVF |
| Posterior | Posterior descending* | Reciprocal changes in V1-V4 |

*From right coronary (80%) or left circumflex (20%)

### Blood Tests
  - Serial troponin (elevated 4-6 hours after injury)
  - FBC, U&E
  - Blood glucose and lipid profile

### Imaging
  - Coronary angiogram (diagnostic investigation of choice)
  - Chest X-ray
  - ECHO

## Initial Management

All ACS patients should receive:
  - Oxygen if SpO2 `<94%`
  - Morphine for analgesia
  - Glyceryl trinitrate
  - Aspirin 300mg

## Management Based on Type

### STEMI Management
  - If `<12` hours since symptom onset and PCI available within 120 minutes:
    - Give anticoagulants and proceed to PCI
  - If `<12` hours since symptom onset and PCI not available in 120 minutes:
    - Give anticoagulants and start thrombolysis
  - If `>12` hours since symptom onset:
    - Medical management with antiplatelet therapy

### NSTEMI/UA Management
  - Risk stratification using GRACE score
  - Low risk: Consider conservative management
  - High risk: Consider immediate angiography if unstable
  - Otherwise: Consider angiography within 72 hours

## Long-term Management
  - Beta blocker (often bisoprolol)
  - ACE-inhibitor
  - Dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 year
  - High dose statin
  - Risk factor modification

    {
      question: "A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm. His ECG shows ST-elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. His troponin levels are elevated. Which coronary artery is most likely occluded?",
      options: [
        "Left anterior descending artery",
        "Left circumflex artery",
        "Right coronary artery",
        "Left main coronary artery"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      correctFeedback: "Correct! ST-elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates an inferior wall MI, which is most commonly (80%) supplied by the right coronary artery via its posterior descending branch.",
      incorrectFeedback: "Review the ECG lead territories and their corresponding blood supply. Think about which leads represent the inferior wall of the heart."
    },
    {
      question: "A 58-year-old diabetic woman presents with fatigue and mild epigastric discomfort for the past 2 hours. Her initial troponin is negative, but rises to 2.1 ng/mL (normal <0.04) after 6 hours. Her ECG shows T-wave inversions in V1-V4. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
      options: [
        "Immediate thrombolysis",
        "Risk stratification using GRACE score",
        "Discharge with follow-up",
        "Immediate cardiac catheterization without risk stratification"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      correctFeedback: "Correct! This patient has NSTEMI (elevated troponins without ST elevation). The next step is risk stratification using the GRACE score to determine the timing of invasive management.",
      incorrectFeedback: "Consider the ECG findings and biomarker pattern. What type of ACS is this, and what does the guidelines recommend as the first step in management for this type?"
    },
    {
      question: "A 45-year-old man undergoes successful PCI for STEMI. Which of the following medications should be prescribed for secondary prevention?",
      options: [
        "Aspirin alone",
        "Warfarin and clopidogrel",
        "Dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 year, then aspirin indefinitely",
        "Triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and rivaroxaban"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      correctFeedback: "Correct! Standard therapy after PCI for STEMI includes dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1 year, followed by aspirin indefinitely, unless there are specific contraindications.",
      incorrectFeedback: "Think about the balance between preventing stent thrombosis and minimizing bleeding risk. What is the standard duration of antiplatelet therapy after coronary stenting?"
