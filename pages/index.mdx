# Acute Coronary Syndrome

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a critical cardiac condition characterized by acute ischemia or infarction of the myocardium. It is a common presentation in emergency medicine and a significant topic on exams like the MSRA and USMLE. Understanding ACS is essential for timely diagnosis and management, which can significantly impact patient outcomes.

## Types of Acute Coronary Syndrome

ACS refers to a continuum of conditions where there is acute ischemia or infarction of the myocardium. The three types are:

1. **Unstable Angina (UA)**: Evidence of myocardial damage (e.g., chest pain at rest) without changes in cardiac biomarkers.
2. **Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)**: Elevated cardiac biomarkers without ST elevation on ECG; represents a partial-thickness infarct.
3. **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)**: Elevated cardiac biomarkers with persistent ST elevation on ECG; represents a full-thickness infarct.

## Risk Factors

Risk factors for ACS can be divided into:

**Modifiable:**

- **Smoking**
- **Type 2 Diabetes**
- **Hypertension**
- **Hypercholesterolemia**
- **Obesity**
- **Sedentary Lifestyle**
- **Cocaine Use**

**Non-Modifiable:**

- **Increasing Age**
- **Male Gender**
- **Family History**

## Clinical Presentation

### Symptoms

Patients with ACS may present with:

- **Central or left-sided "crushing" chest pain** radiating to the jaw or left arm
- **Shortness of breath**
- **Sweating**
- **Nausea and vomiting**

*Note: Atypical presentations (e.g., dyspepsia, absence of chest pain) may occur in females, diabetics, or the elderly.*

### Physical Signs

- Often, there are **few physical signs** in ACS patients.

## Investigations

### Bedside

- **Basic Observations**
- **Serial ECGs**

  - **STEMI**: ST-elevation in specific leads depending on the area of infarction.
  - **NSTEMI or UA**: T-wave inversion or ST-depression.
  - *Continuous ECG changes suggest an evolving myocardial infarction.*

| **Posterior**   | Posterior descending artery (from right coronary in 80% or left circumflex in 20%)                         | *Reciprocal changes*: Prominent R waves, flat ST depression, T-wave inversion in V1-V4 |

### Detailed ECG Changes

<details>
<summary>Click here for detailed ECG changes and their significance</summary>

- **ST-Elevation**: Indicates transmural (full-thickness) myocardial infarction.
- **T-Wave Inversion**: Suggests ischemia.
- **ST-Depression**: May indicate subendocardial ischemia or NSTEMI.
- **Reciprocal Changes**: ST-depression in leads opposite to those with ST-elevation.

</details>

### Blood Tests

- **Cardiac Markers**

  - **Troponin**: Raised in NSTEMI and STEMI 4-6 hours after injury; remains elevated for up to 10 days.

    <Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    **Note:** Troponin levels can remain elevated for up to 10 days after myocardial injury.
    </Callout>

  - **CK-MB** and **Myoglobin** can also be measured.

- **Full Blood Count (FBC)**: Check for anemia.
- **Urea and Electrolytes (U&E)**: Hyperkalemia may cause arrhythmias.
- **Blood Glucose and Lipid Profile**: Assess for risk factors.

### Imaging

- **Coronary Angiogram**: The diagnostic investigation of choice.
- **Chest X-ray**: To exclude differential diagnoses like pneumothorax.
- **Echocardiogram (ECHO)**: Assess heart function.

## Emergency Management

As in any emergency, an **ABCDE approach** should be taken when a patient presents with ACS.

### Immediate Management

All ACS patients should initially receive:

- **Oxygen** if `SpO2 <94%`
- **Analgesia** â€“ commonly **morphine**
- **Nitrates** (e.g., glyceryl trinitrate)
- **Aspirin 300 mg**

## Management

Management depends on whether the diagnosis is STEMI, NSTEMI, or UA.

### Management of STEMI

- **If symptom onset is `<12 hours` and PCI is available within 120 minutes:**

  - Administer anticoagulants.
  - Proceed to **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)**.

- **If symptom onset is `<12 hours` and PCI is not available within 120 minutes:**

  - Administer anticoagulants.
  - Begin **thrombolysis** with drugs such as **alteplase**.

- **If symptom onset is `>12 hours`:**

  - **Medical Management:**

    - Offer **ticagrelor** with **aspirin** unless high bleeding risk.
    - Consider **clopidogrel** with **aspirin**, or **aspirin alone**, for high bleeding risk.

For more information, see: [NICE Guidelines on STEMI](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng185/resources/visual-summary-stemi-pdf-8900623405)

### Management of NSTEMI and Unstable Angina

Patients are risk stratified using the **GRACE score**.

- **Low Risk:**

  - Consider conservative management without angiography.
  - Offer **ticagrelor** with **aspirin** unless high bleeding risk.
  - Consider **clopidogrel** with **aspirin**, or **aspirin alone**, for high bleeding risk.

- **High Risk:**

  - If clinically unstable, provide immediate angiography.
  - Otherwise, consider angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) within 72 hours if no contraindications.
  - If no separate indication for oral anticoagulation, offer **ticagrelor** with **aspirin**.
  - If there is a separate indication for oral anticoagulation, offer **clopidogrel** with **aspirin**.

For more information, see: [NICE Guidelines on NSTEMI and UA](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng185/resources/visual-summary-unstable-angina-nstemi-pdf-8900622109)

### Long-term Management

- **Beta Blocker** â€“ often **bisoprolol** as it is cardioselective.
- **ACE-Inhibitor**.
- **Dual Antiplatelet Therapy** for 1 year, then **aspirin 75 mg** indefinitely.
- **High-dose Statin** (e.g., **atorvastatin 80 mg**).

## Complications

Patients should be monitored for complications and treated accordingly.

### Early Complications (`<2 weeks`)

- **Arrhythmias**
- **Ventricular Septal Defect**
- **Mitral Regurgitation** due to papillary muscle rupture
- **Ventricular Wall Rupture**
- **Pericarditis**

### Late Complications (`>2 weeks`)

- **Heart Failure**
- **Dressler's Syndrome**

  <Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Note:** Dressler's syndrome is an autoimmune pericarditis occurring weeks after myocardial infarction; it is managed with NSAIDs.
  </Callout>

- **Ventricular Aneurysm**

## Risk Factor Modification

Long-term management includes addressing modifiable risk factors:

- **Good Diabetic Control**
- **Smoking Cessation**
- **Blood Pressure Control**
- **Statin Therapy** for hypercholesterolemia
- **Diet and Exercise**
