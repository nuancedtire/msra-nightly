# Understanding Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis)

Tennis elbow, medically known as *lateral epicondylitis*, is a chronic condition resulting from degenerative tendinosis. It affects the tendon attachment of the forearm's extensor muscles to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, specifically impacting the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon. This condition is prevalent among individuals in their 40s and 50s and is recognized as a common overuse injury. It is often associated with repetitive arm movements, such as those seen in tennis, construction work, and kayaking, which lead to microtears in the tendon and subsequently initiate a degenerative process.

## Diagnosis

Tennis elbow is suspected when patients within the typical age range report a history of repetitive strain. Key symptoms include elbow pain around the lateral epicondyle when the arm is extended. During a physical examination, the following signs may be observed:

- **Reduced grip strength:** Often due to pain.
- **Point tenderness:** Localized to the lateral epicondyle.
- **Pain on resisted wrist and digit extension**

## Investigations

Routine investigations are generally unnecessary for diagnosing lateral epicondylitis. However, tests may be conducted to rule out other conditions, especially if the patient presents with red flags such as joint swelling, trauma, or systemic symptoms. In such instances, imaging like an elbow X-ray or MRI can be helpful.

## Management

### Prescribing Treatment

Initial treatment involves the use of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or diclofenac, typically recommended within the first few weeks post-injury.

### Non-Prescribing Treatment

The primary management goal for tennis elbow is to alleviate pain and restore joint function. Initial strategies include:

- **Ice therapy** and *activity modification:* Avoiding heavy lifting, gripping, or twisting activities.

For persistent symptoms, consider:

- **Corticosteroid injections:** These can provide short-term relief when administered to the tendon origin.
- **Physiotherapy referral:** Eccentric strengthening and stretching exercises can offer long-term symptom relief.
- **Forearm straps and wrist extension splints:** These aids can help offload stress and reduce tendon activity.

**Note:** Surgical intervention may be considered if symptoms are refractory to treatment after 6-12 months, potentially involving debridement of abnormal tissue at the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon.
