# Understanding Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, recurring, and potentially life-threatening inflammatory disease that affects connective tissues. As a multisystem autoimmune disorder, it often presents with musculoskeletal and skin symptoms and can also impact the blood vessels, kidneys, and central nervous system. Prompt treatment is crucial to reduce mortality, especially from lupus nephritis.

## Diagnosis

SLE predominantly affects women of reproductive age, with an incidence rate of approximately 5 in 100,000. Key symptoms include:

- **Fatigue**
- **Skin rashes** often appearing as a "butterfly rash"
- **Joint pain and swelling**
- **Headaches**
- **Anemia**

About 90% of patients experience polyarthritis (joint pain), making it challenging to differentiate from rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosing SLE can be complex due to its varied and sometimes vague presentation, which can even begin with severe organ dysfunction. Symptoms can be categorized as non-specific or specific.

### Non-Specific Symptoms

- Fatigue
- Weight loss or gain
- Fever
- Swollen glands
- High blood pressure
- Headaches
- Vasculitis
- Hair loss
- Miscarriages
- Raynaud’s Phenomenon

### Specific Symptoms

- **Malar rash:** A red "butterfly rash" across both cheeks
- **Discoid rash:** Red, scaly patches on the face or scalp
- **Photosensitivity:** Rash triggered by sunlight exposure
- **Mucosal ulcers:** Sores in the mucosal lining of the nose and mouth
- **Serositis:** Inflammation of the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum
- **Arthritis:** Common in SLE
- **Renal disorder:** Detected via routine blood and urine tests
- **Neurological disorder:** Symptoms like psychosis or seizures
- **Hematological disorder:** Conditions such as hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia
- **Immunological disorder:** Anti-DNA and anti-Sm antibodies (LE cell tests)
- **Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA test):** Present in 97% of patients, though not exclusively indicative of SLE

To diagnose SLE, a patient must have at least 4 of these 11 specific criteria at any time since the onset of the illness.

## Investigations

- **Blood Tests:** Look for anemia, elevated ESR, normal CRP, and leukopenia.
- **Antibodies:**
  - **ANA positive:** Found in 99% of patients, though it's non-specific.
  - **Anti-DNA:** More specific and may indicate disease activity.
- **Urine Sample:** To check for kidney damage like proteinuria.
- **Cardiolipin Antibodies/Lupus Anticoagulant:** These increase the risk of miscarriage and thrombosis.

Antibodies can be detected years before an official diagnosis. SLE patients are at an elevated risk for coronary disease.

## Management (Prescribing)

Currently, no cure exists for SLE. For minor pain, paracetamol is recommended. Mild symptoms like skin rashes, joint/muscle pain, and fatigue are managed with NSAIDs, antimalarials like hydroxychloroquine, or low-dose corticosteroids. Severe symptoms, particularly renal issues, require a combination of prednisolone and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. Anticoagulation therapy may involve aspirin, warfarin, or heparin.

**Warning:** Follow local guidelines for steroid, pain medication, and anticoagulation choices.

**Plasmapheresis** can be used as emergency treatment or when other drugs are contraindicated.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Although SLE requires medication, pain management significantly affects quality of life. Physical activity and physiotherapy have shown effectiveness.

On examination, you notice a butterfly-shaped rash across her cheeks. Which of the following laboratory findings would most likely support a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)?",
    options: [
      "Positive rheumatoid factor",
      "Positive Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) test",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Neurological disorders such as psychosis and seizures are indicative of central nervous system involvement in SLE.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Focus on symptoms that involve the central nervous system, which can manifest as psychiatric or neurological alterations."
  },
