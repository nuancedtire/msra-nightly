# Understanding Pseudogout: Calcium Pyrophosphate Crystal Arthritis

Pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis, involves the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammatory arthritis. This condition primarily affects the hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles. Chronic pseudogout can resemble osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

## Diagnosis

**Risk Factors:**

- Family history of pseudogout
- Previous joint injury or surgery
- Advanced age
- Hyperparathyroidism
- Haemochromatosis
- Hypomagnesemia
- Hypophosphatasia

**Clinical Features:**

- Painful joints
- Joint effusion, redness, and warmth
- Sudden exacerbation of pre-existing osteoarthritis
- In elderly patients, symptoms may include malaise and fever

## Investigations

- **Synovial Fluid Analysis**: The definitive test for pseudogout, distinguishing it from septic arthritis and gout. The presence of rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent calcium pyrophosphate crystals confirms the diagnosis.
  
- **X-ray Imaging**: May reveal joint changes resembling osteoarthritis but often more severe, with possible cartilage calcification.
  
- **Blood Tests**: To identify underlying causes:
  - Serum calcium
  - Iron studies (for haemochromatosis)
  - Serum parathyroid hormone
  - Serum alkaline phosphatase (for hypophosphatasia)
  - Serum magnesium (for hypomagnesemia)

## Management (Prescribing)

Pseudogout is painful, necessitating effective pain management. Consider the following treatment options:

- **Analgesia**: NSAIDs such as diclofenac or naproxen, along with paracetamol, should be used if there are no contraindications.
  
- **Intra-articular Corticosteroids**: Options include hexacetonide, dexamethasone, or triamcinolone for mono- or oligo-articular disease.
  
- **Colchicine**: Use if steroid injections are declined or contraindicated.
  
- **Systemic Corticosteroids**: For severe cases unresponsive to intra-articular steroids and analgesia.

**Warning:** Always consult a healthcare professional before initiating treatment.

## Management (Non-prescribing)

In addition to medication, some patients may find relief through:

- Ice application
- Joint splinting
- Joint aspiration

*Currently, there are no licensed medications for the regular prevention of pseudogout attacks.*

<details>
<summary>Detailed Pathophysiology</summary>

Pseudogout occurs when calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals accumulate in the joint. This crystal deposition triggers an inflammatory response similar to that seen in gout, but with distinct crystal characteristics.
