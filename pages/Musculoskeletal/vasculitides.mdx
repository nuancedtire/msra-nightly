# Understanding Polyarteritis Nodosa

Polyarteritis nodosa is a type of vasculitis that affects medium-sized blood vessels. This condition primarily presents with **non-specific systemic symptoms** such as fever, weight loss, joint pain (arthralgia), and fatigue. It may also cause changes in the skin, such as *livedo reticularis*—a mottled, purplish discoloration of the skin.

## Clinical Features

- **Systemic Symptoms:**
  - Fever
  - Weight loss
  - Arthralgia
  - Lethargy

- **Cutaneous Manifestations:**
  - Livedo reticularis

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Note:** Polyarteritis nodosa less commonly affects the pulmonary vasculature, unlike similar conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis.

## Organ Involvement

- **Cardiac and Renal Systems:**
  - These systems may show a characteristic *string-of-beads* appearance due to the formation of aneurysms, also known as the **rosary sign**.

## Diagnostic Criteria

The American College of Rheumatology has established a set of criteria for diagnosing polyarteritis nodosa, which includes:

1. Positive hepatitis B serology, reflecting its strong association with hepatitis B infection.
2. Absence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), which differentiates it from other types of vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

<summary>Additional Diagnostic Information</summary>

Polyarteritis nodosa is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and sometimes, tissue biopsy. The absence of ANCA is a key differentiating factor from other vasculitides.

## Summary

Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare but significant condition affecting medium-sized vessels, with diverse systemic and cutaneous manifestations. Its diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation and specific criteria, notably its association with hepatitis B and the absence of ANCA.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old male presents with fever, weight loss, arthralgia, and livedo reticularis. He is also found to have renal involvement with aneurysms showing a 'string-of-beads' appearance on imaging. Which of the following laboratory findings would most likely support the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa?",
    options: [
      "Positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)",
      "Positive hepatitis B serology",
      "Elevated rheumatoid factor",
      "Elevated anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)",
      "Low complement levels"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Polyarteritis nodosa is strongly associated with hepatitis B infection, and positive hepatitis B serology supports the diagnosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the associations that help differentiate polyarteritis nodosa from other vasculitides. ANCA is typically absent in polyarteritis nodosa."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following clinical features is least likely to be associated with polyarteritis nodosa?",
    options: [
      "Fever",
      "Pulmonary vasculitis",
      "Livedo reticularis",
      "Renal artery aneurysms",
      "Weight loss"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Pulmonary vasculitis is less commonly associated with polyarteritis nodosa, unlike other vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Review the distinguishing features of polyarteritis nodosa, particularly its lack of pulmonary involvement."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with polyarteritis nodosa presents with systemic symptoms and skin changes. Which skin manifestation is most characteristic of this condition?",
    options: [
      "Butterfly rash",
      "Livedo reticularis",
      "Erythema nodosum",
      "Psoriatic plaques",
      "Petechiae"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Livedo reticularis, a mottled, purplish discoloration of the skin, is a characteristic cutaneous manifestation of polyarteritis nodosa.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the specific skin changes associated with medium-sized vessel vasculitis like polyarteritis nodosa."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following criteria is NOT part of the diagnostic criteria for polyarteritis nodosa established by the American College of Rheumatology?",
    options: [
      "Positive hepatitis B serology",
      "Absence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)",
      "Presence of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)",
      "Systemic symptoms such as fever and weight loss",
      "Renal artery aneurysms"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) is not part of the diagnostic criteria for polyarteritis nodosa.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Focus on the specific laboratory and clinical findings that are used to differentiate polyarteritis nodosa from other types of vasculitis."
