# Understanding De Quervain's Tenosynovitis

De Quervain’s tenosynovitis is a condition affecting the tendons of the thumb, specifically the **abductor pollicis longus (APL)** and the **extensor pollicis brevis (EPB)**, located on the radial side of the wrist. Contrary to some beliefs, it is not primarily an inflammatory process; histological examinations often reveal myxoid degeneration. This condition predominantly affects women aged 30 to 50 and is commonly linked to repetitive hand movements or activities. It is marked by the narrowing of the passage where the tendons move over the styloid process of the radius, entering a fibro-osseous canal that separates the forearm from the hand. This results in pain and tenderness, which increase with thumb or wrist movement and while grasping objects.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis of De Quervain’s tenosynovitis is suspected with radial wrist pain and tenderness without recent trauma. Key examination features include:

- Swelling and enlargement over the radial styloid process
- Pain elicited by the **Finkelstein manoeuvre**: In this test, the patient covers their thumb with their fingers, and the examiner rotates the wrist, stretching the tendons both passively and actively.

**Differential Diagnoses:**

- **Osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint**: Common in older adults, with pain distal to the radial styloid.
- **Radial nerve entrapment**: Uncommon, characterized by burning pain and paraesthesia.
- **Intersection syndrome**: Pain is more dorsal and proximal.
- **Ganglion cyst**: Typically painless, located more dorsally and proximally.
- **Gouty arthritis**: Acute pain and swelling with erythema.

## Investigations

De Quervain’s tenosynovitis is primarily diagnosed clinically. X-rays are usually normal, but some imaging techniques can provide further insights:

- **Ultrasound**: Shows thickening of involved tendons and possibly thinning of the EPB tendon due to stenosis and a thickened extensor retinaculum. Useful for assessing tendon alterations and their relationship with the retinaculum.
- **Doppler ultrasound**: Indicates hypervascularity.

## Management (Prescribing)

De Quervain’s tenosynovitis often resolves naturally within a year, thus treatment focuses on pain relief. **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** are commonly prescribed.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Conservative management is the primary approach, involving:

- **Thumb spica splint**: Stabilizes the thumb while allowing other fingers to move. Complete immobilization is avoided as it does not alter the condition's course.
- **Rest and ice**: Recommended to alleviate symptoms.
- **Wrist and hand exercises**: May be beneficial.

If symptoms persist after splinting and NSAIDs, **glucocorticoid injections** may be considered. They are also a first-line treatment for severe symptoms, typically using a combination of methylprednisolone and a local anesthetic.

For patients whose symptoms do not improve with splinting, oral or injected anti-inflammatory drugs, **surgery** may be advised. This procedure involves opening the dorsal compartment to relieve tendon pressure and is usually effective.

  {
    question: "A 35-year-old woman presents with pain on the radial side of her wrist, worsened by grasping objects and thumb movements. The Finkelstein test is positive. Which tendons are primarily involved in De Quervain's tenosynovitis?",
    options: [
      "Flexor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis longus",
      "Abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis",
      "Flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris",
      "Extensor digitorum and extensor indicis",
      "Flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! De Quervain's tenosynovitis primarily involves the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Incorrect. Consider the tendons that are located on the radial side of the wrist and are involved in thumb movement."
  },
  {
    question: "Which imaging technique is useful in diagnosing De Quervain's tenosynovitis by showing tendon thickening and hypervascularity?",
    options: [
      "X-ray",
      "MRI",
      "CT scan",
      "Ultrasound with Doppler",
      "Bone scintigraphy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Ultrasound with Doppler can show tendon thickening and hypervascularity, aiding in the diagnosis of De Quervain's tenosynovitis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Incorrect. Consider a non-invasive imaging technique that can visualize soft tissue changes and blood flow."
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with De Quervain's tenosynovitis has not responded to NSAIDs and thumb spica splinting. What is the next recommended treatment step?",
    options: [
      "Surgical decompression",
      "Physical therapy",
      "Glucocorticoid injection",
      "Oral corticosteroids",
      "Chiropractic manipulation"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! A glucocorticoid injection is often the next step when conservative management with NSAIDs and splinting fails.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Incorrect. Consider an intervention that directly addresses inflammation in a localized manner."
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following conditions is least likely to be confused with De Quervain's tenosynovitis based on the location and nature of the pain?",
    options: [
      "Osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint",
      "Radial nerve entrapment",
      "Intersection syndrome",
      "Ganglion cyst",
      "Gouty arthritis"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Intersection syndrome usually causes pain more dorsally and proximally, away from the radial styloid, unlike De Quervain's.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Incorrect. Consider whether the condition involves pain that is more proximal or dorsal compared to De Quervain's."
