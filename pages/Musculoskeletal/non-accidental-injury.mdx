# Understanding Non-Accidental Injury in Children

Non-accidental injury (NAI) in children is a crucial diagnosis indicating potential **physical abuse**. It is essential to recognize and differentiate these cases from accidental injuries.

## Types of Child Abuse

Child abuse can manifest in several forms, including:

- **Physical abuse**
- **Emotional/Psychological abuse**
- **Sexual abuse**
- **Neglect**

*Reference: Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialities (9th Edition) - Page 146*

## Diagnosis of Non-Accidental Injury

Consider a diagnosis of NAI if any of the following criteria are met:

1. The history provided is inconsistent or frequently changing.
2. Injuries do not align with the given history.
3. The injury does not match the child's developmental stage (e.g., long bone fractures in a non-mobile child).
4. There is visible evidence of poor parent-child bonding.
5. The child is already under the notice of social services.

### Risk Factors

Certain factors may increase the likelihood of NAI:

- Presence of violence in the home
- Substance abuse by parents or carers
- Mental health disorders in parents or carers
- Poor stress management skills in parents or carers
- Low socioeconomic status

### Initial Assessment

During the assessment of an injured child, it is crucial to collect information non-judgmentally. Consider rare medical conditions that can mimic signs of NAI, such as:

- Hemophilia causing bruising
- Osteogenesis imperfecta leading to fractures
- Osteoporosis resulting from propionic acidaemia causing fractures

## Investigations

When a child presents with injuries, conduct investigations to:

1. Rule out differential diagnoses unrelated to NAI, such as coagulopathies.
2. Detect evidence of additional injuries, potentially involving:
   - Skeletal survey
   - Ophthalmology evaluation
   - CT head scan

## Management

### Pharmacological Management

Address any injuries with appropriate medical treatment, guided by the injury type.

### Non-Pharmacological Management

#### Confidentiality Considerations

Managing NAI involves balancing child welfare with confidentiality. If NAI is suspected, doctors should:

- Investigate other forms of child maltreatment.
- Discuss the case with a senior colleague or a safeguarding lead.

If both parties agree that NAI is a possibility, confidentiality must be breached to inform local authorities. You don't need certainty of abuse; the potential negative outcomes of withholding information should outweigh those of sharing it.

**Important:** According to GMC guidelines, sharing confidential information is permissible if:
- Legally required,
- Consent is obtained,
- The benefits of sharing outweigh the reasons for confidentiality.
</Callout>

When sharing information, include:

1. Child's identity
2. Parents' identity
3. Identity of the suspected perpetrator
4. Reason for concerns
5. Relevant case information only

Inform the family of the obligation to share information, ideally obtaining their consent. Explain:

- Information details to be shared
- Recipients of the information
- Purpose of the information usage
- Sources for independent advice and support

Avoid discussing with the family if:

- Delays increase risk to the child or others
- Consent requests heighten the risk
- Disclosure is justified in public interest

#### Ongoing Management

Management post-NAI diagnosis is specific to each case, depending on the child's safety at home. Interventions often focus on enhancing parenting skills.

Removing a child from their family is reserved for extreme scenarios where safety is undeniably compromised.

  {
    question: "A 2-year-old child is brought to the emergency department with a femur fracture. The parents report that the child fell off a low bed. On examination, you notice multiple bruises of different ages on the child's body. The child is not yet walking independently. Which of the following findings would most strongly suggest non-accidental injury?",
    options: [
      "The presence of multiple bruises",
      "The child's age and the nature of the fracture",
      "The parents' report of a fall from a bed",
      "The child being not yet ambulatory",
      "The parents appearing anxious and concerned"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Long bone fractures in a non-mobile child are highly suspicious for non-accidental injury, as such injuries are unlikely to occur in children who do not walk independently.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the correlation between the child's developmental stage and the nature of the injuries. What injuries are unlikely to be self-inflicted in a non-mobile child?"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a risk factor that may increase the likelihood of non-accidental injury in children?",
    options: [
      "High socioeconomic status",
      "Stable home environment",
      "Parents with good stress management skills",
      "Presence of violence in the home",
      "Parents with a strong support network"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The presence of violence in the home is a significant risk factor for non-accidental injury in children, as it can create an unsafe environment.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about factors that negatively impact a child's environment and parental ability to provide safe care."

    question: "A 6-year-old child presents with a spiral fracture of the humerus. The child's parents state that the injury occurred while playing on the playground. As part of your assessment, you consider possible differential diagnoses. Which of the following conditions should be considered to rule out a medical mimic of non-accidental injury?",
    options: [
      "Osteogenesis imperfecta",
      "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis",
      "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome",
      "Simple febrile seizures",
      "Functional abdominal pain"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Osteogenesis imperfecta is a condition that can cause fractures with minimal trauma and should be considered to rule out a medical mimic of non-accidental injury.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider medical conditions that can predispose a child to fractures with minimal or no trauma."
  },
  {
    question: "When suspecting non-accidental injury, a healthcare professional is considering breaching confidentiality to inform local authorities. Under what condition is this action permissible according to GMC guidelines?",
    options: [
      "The child has no visible injuries",
      "The parents have refused consent",
      "There is a legal requirement to share information",
