# Mononeuritis Multiplex: Comprehensive Overview

Mononeuritis multiplex is a type of peripheral neuropathy characterized by the dysfunction of multiple distinct nerves. This dysfunction may occur sequentially or simultaneously, but symptoms are localized to the specific areas corresponding to the affected nerves. This condition differs from **peripheral polyneuropathies**, which present diffuse peripheral symptoms. When the affected nerves show a symmetrical distribution, differentiating mononeuritis multiplex from peripheral polyneuropathy can be challenging. Accurate history taking and understanding the symptom timeline are crucial for distinguishing between these two conditions.

## Pathophysiology

Mononeuritis multiplex results from ischemic damage to nerves, often caused by the occlusion of blood vessels supplying the nerves due to inflammation (vasculitis).

Vasculitides leading to mononeuritis multiplex may be **primary**, occurring spontaneously, or **secondary**, resulting from factors such as infections, adverse drug reactions, or malignancies.

## Diagnosis

Mononeuritis multiplex typically presents as a **painful, sensory, and motor** deficit with an **acute or subacute** onset. Key historical features include:

- Weakness and loss of sensation
- Pain associated with neurological deficits
- Acute or subacute onset

### Common Causes

The most frequent cause is vasculitis, which can be primary or secondary to other conditions. Other causes include:

- **Infective conditions:**
  - HIV
  - Hepatitis B
  - Hepatitis C
- **Metabolic conditions:**
  - Diabetes Mellitus
- **Neoplastic conditions:**
  - Lymphoma
  - Carcinoma
- **Inherited conditions:**
  - Hereditary neuropathy with a predisposition to pressure palsies

Given the numerous potential underlying etiologies, patient evaluation should focus on:

1. Confirming the diagnosis of mononeuritis multiplex.
2. Identifying evidence of underlying conditions contributing to the condition (see Investigations).

## Investigations

Investigations aim to confirm the diagnosis and explore underlying causes.

### Confirming the Diagnosis

Electromyogram (EMG) studies confirm the condition by comparing conduction in affected and unaffected nerves. Identifying specific affected nerves is essential for accurate EMG testing, and consultation with a neuromuscular neurologist is advisable.

### Investigating the Cause

Investigations should target the most likely causes based on clinical history and examination. Nerve biopsy can confirm the diagnosis and occasionally reveal a treatable cause.

## Management

### Prescribing Management

Management varies depending on the underlying cause of the neuropathy. Typically, corticosteroids reduce inflammation in affected blood vessels and nerves. Common prescriptions include prednisolone ± methylprednisolone. Additional therapies may be warranted based on the underlying cause. Consulting a neuromuscular neurologist is recommended for guidance on steroid dosage.

### Non-Prescribing Management

Patients should be managed by specialists relevant to the underlying condition causing the neuropathy. For example, mononeuritis multiplex secondary to Hepatitis-C-associated cryoglobulinaemia requires collaboration among a hepatologist, an infectious disease consultant, and a neuromuscular neurologist.

If mononeuritis multiplex is the initial presentation of an underlying condition, follow-up for other complications, such as regular renal monitoring in vasculitis patients, is critical.

  {
    question: "A 45-year-old male presents with acute onset of right wrist drop and left foot drop. The patient has a history of hepatitis B infection and has been experiencing joint pain and skin rashes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms?",
    options: [

      "Carcinoma",
      "HIV infection"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's acute asymmetric motor deficits and history of hepatitis B suggest vasculitis-associated mononeuritis multiplex. Vasculitis can cause ischemic damage to nerves due to inflammation of blood vessels.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the role of blood vessel inflammation in the pathophysiology of the patient's symptoms. What condition is associated with hepatitis B and can lead to mononeuritis multiplex?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 60-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes presents with a sudden onset of numbness and weakness in her right hand and left foot. On examination, there is evidence of sensory and motor deficits in the affected areas. Which of the following investigations is most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis of mononeuritis multiplex?",
    options: [
      "Nerve biopsy",
      "MRI of the brain",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Electromyography (EMG) is the most appropriate investigation to confirm mononeuritis multiplex, as it assesses the conduction in affected and unaffected nerves, providing crucial diagnostic information.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the diagnostic modality that evaluates nerve conduction and can help differentiate between affected and unaffected nerves in peripheral neuropathies."
