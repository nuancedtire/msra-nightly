# Psoriatic Arthritis: A Comprehensive Guide

Psoriatic arthritis (PA) is a seronegative chronic inflammatory condition affecting the musculoskeletal system, particularly the joints. It is characterized by joint swelling, pain, and stiffness and is often associated with psoriasis. Like psoriasis, PA is a long-term condition that can progressively worsen if not treated, potentially leading to a polyarticular pattern of joint involvement.

## Diagnosis

PA primarily affects young to middle-aged individuals, frequently those with a history of psoriasis. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical history and physical examination, focusing on recognizing inflammatory joint symptoms.

### Common Symptoms

- History of psoriasis
- Morning joint stiffness lasting at least 30 minutes
- Swelling of joints and/or digits (dactylitis)
- Foot pain upon taking the first step in the morning

In cases without a known history of psoriasis, examination should seek evidence of psoriasis, including pitted nails and inflamed, red regions with silver-white plaques, typically on the scalp, elbows, knees, and extensor regions of the limbs.

**Note:** Symptoms of PA may resemble those of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is crucial to differentiate them through joint involvement patterns and assess spinal mobility to exclude spondylitis.

## Investigations

Patients exhibiting clinical signs of joint inflammation should undergo an x-ray of the affected areas, especially the hands and feet. Typical x-ray findings include:

- Erosion of the distal interphalangeal joints
- Periarticular bone formation

In advanced disease stages, osteolytic changes such as pencil-in-cup deformity or arthritis mutilans may occur.

Blood tests may reveal elevated ESR and/or CRP levels, though these are not specific to PA. Testing for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) is recommended for patients with polyarthritis. RF, although commonly linked to autoimmune conditions like RA and Sjogren’s syndrome, can also be positive in non-RA patients.

An MRI scan of the sacroiliac joint region, while not always routine, can help identify early sacroiliitis even in the absence of x-ray changes. Abnormal findings might sometimes be found in asymptomatic patients.

## Management (Prescribing)

### Limited Peripheral Joint Disease

- **First-line treatment:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
  - *Note:* Evaluate the patient's risk for gastric ulcers before prescribing. For long-term NSAID use, prescribe a concurrent Proton Pump Inhibitor (e.g., Omeprazole).
- **Adjunct therapies:**
  - Intra-articular corticosteroid injection
  - Physiotherapy

### Progressive Peripheral Joint Disease or Spondylitis/Enthesitis

- **First-line treatment:** Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (e.g., methotrexate)
  - **Plus:** NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and/or intra-articular corticosteroid injections
- **Second-line treatment:** TNF-alpha inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies
  - **Plus:** Continued NSAIDs and physiotherapy

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Daily physiotherapy is essential to improve the range of motion in affected joints. Over time, physiotherapy can help alleviate pain and strengthen the muscles around the joints.

  {
    question: "A 35-year-old man presents with joint pain and swelling, primarily affecting his fingers and toes. He has a known history of psoriasis. On examination, you note dactylitis and pitted nails. Which of the following investigations would be most helpful in differentiating psoriatic arthritis from rheumatoid arthritis?",
    options: [
      "Elevated ESR and CRP levels",
      "Positive rheumatoid factor (RF) test",
      "X-ray showing erosion of distal interphalangeal joints",
      "MRI of sacroiliac joints",
      "Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody test"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! X-ray findings showing erosion of the distal interphalangeal joints are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis and help differentiate it from rheumatoid arthritis, which more commonly affects the proximal interphalangeal joints.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider which investigation specifically highlights joint involvement patterns that are unique to psoriatic arthritis as opposed to rheumatoid arthritis."
  },
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old woman with a history of psoriasis presents with morning stiffness lasting over 30 minutes and foot pain upon taking the first step in the morning. An X-ray reveals pencil-in-cup deformities. What is the most appropriate first-line treatment for her limited peripheral joint disease?",
    options: [
      "Methotrexate",
      "TNF-alpha inhibitors",
      "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)",
      "Intra-articular corticosteroid injection",
      "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! NSAIDs are the first-line treatment for limited peripheral joint disease in psoriatic arthritis, aimed at reducing inflammation and pain.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the initial management strategies that focus on symptomatic relief in cases of limited joint involvement."
  },
  {
    question: "A 50-year-old patient with known psoriatic arthritis presents with worsening joint symptoms and newly developed spinal stiffness. Despite NSAID treatment, his symptoms progress. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    options: [
      "Increase NSAID dosage",
      "Start physiotherapy",
      "Initiate methotrexate",
      "Prescribe TNF-alpha inhibitors",
      "Offer intra-articular corticosteroid injections"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! For progressive peripheral joint disease or newly developed spondylitis, initiating methotrexate, a DMARD, is appropriate to control disease progression.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider treatments that address both peripheral joint and spinal involvement in psoriatic arthritis."

    question: "In a patient with psoriatic arthritis, which of the following clinical features is most likely to differentiate it from rheumatoid arthritis during physical examination?",
    options: [
      "Morning stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes",
      "Symmetrical joint involvement",
      "Pitted nails and dactylitis",
