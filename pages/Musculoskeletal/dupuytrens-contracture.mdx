# Understanding Dupuytren’s Contracture

Dupuytren’s contracture is a condition affecting the hand, characterized by the progressive thickening and fibrosis of the palmar fascia due to fibroblastic proliferation and collagen deposition. The initial indication of this condition is often the appearance of palmar nodules, which can be either painful or painless, and are considered pathognomonic for Dupuytren’s contracture. In some cases, fascial cords develop, leading to finger contractures that can result in permanent stiffness. While the exact cause is unknown, genetic factors are thought to play a role, and there is an association with repetitive hand movements, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol consumption, and other fibrotic disorders, such as Peyronie’s disease.

Dupuytren’s contracture is more common in white males over the age of 50, where the onset and severity tend to be greater compared to females. Typically, the condition affects the ulnar side of the hand, with the fourth and fifth fingers being more frequently involved than others.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing Dupuytren’s contracture is primarily clinical, supported by specific physical examination findings:

- **Palpable or visible nodules**
- **Palpable or visible cords**
- **Finger contractures on the palm**

A "tabletop test" can assess the severity; if a patient can lay their palms flat on a table, the contracture is considered mild. Generally, patients do not experience pain, tenderness, or swelling unless tenosynovitis is also present.

### Differential Diagnosis

Consider these conditions when diagnosing:

- **Diabetic cheiroarthropathy:** Limited mobility in all fingers except the thumb, without nodules or cords.
- **Palmar fibromatosis:** Progressive contracture of all fingers in both hands, often associated with malignancies.
- **Stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger):** Dynamic contracture corrected with a "snap" or trigger, unlike the fixed nature of Dupuytren’s contracture.

## Investigations

Dupuytren’s contracture is diagnosed clinically; hence, imaging or further investigations are typically unnecessary. An X-ray would appear normal as there is no tendon calcification.

## Management (Non-prescribing)

Treatment aims to relieve contractures and restore full finger extension, varying with disease severity:

- **Mild:** Does not affect daily activities
  - Modify activities involving repetitive hand movements or use padded gloves.
  
- **Moderate:** Partially affects daily activities
  - **Radiotherapy**
  - **Glucocorticoid injections** (e.g., triamcinolone and lidocaine) for tenderness or rapidly growing nodules. Effective for nodules, but not cords or contractures.
  
- **Severe:** Significantly affects daily activities due to flexion contractures
  - **Open fasciotomy:** Transection of cords.
  - **Percutaneous needle fasciotomy/aponeurectomy:** Less invasive but less effective than open fasciotomy.
  - **Open fasciectomy:** Removal of thickened fascial cords. Most invasive but lowest recurrence risk.
  - **Collagenase injection:** Effective for less severe contractures (``<50°``). May be used for severe cases if non-surgical options are preferred, though full range of motion restoration is less likely.
