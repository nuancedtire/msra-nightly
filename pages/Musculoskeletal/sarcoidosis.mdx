# Understanding Sarcoidosis: A Comprehensive Overview

Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystem disorder of unknown origin, characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas. It primarily affects the lungs, skin, and eyes. The condition is most prevalent in Northern Europe, especially Scandinavia, and is more common in females. The typical age of onset is in the third and fourth decades of life.

## Diagnosis

Although sarcoidosis can affect any organ, over 90% of cases involve the lungs, presenting with symptoms such as cough, wheezing, or exertional dyspnea. Thus, sarcoidosis should be considered in young adults with unexplained cough or shortness of breath. Common constitutional symptoms include fever, weight loss, and chronic fatigue. Other clinical features include:

- **Hepatomegaly**
- **Splenomegaly**
- **Lymphadenopathy**
- **Ocular involvement**: anterior uveitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca
- **Hypercalcemia and nephrocalcinosis**
- **Erythema nodosum**
- **Neurological symptoms**: seizures, cranial nerve palsies, and peripheral neuropathy
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**

A notable syndrome associated with sarcoidosis is *Löfgren syndrome*, characterized by acute onset of erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, fever, and arthralgia. This combination is highly indicative of sarcoidosis and often does not require further investigation.

## Investigations

Diagnosing sarcoidosis involves excluding other conditions and requires both clinical and radiological evidence, along with pathological confirmation of non-caseating granulomas.

Initial investigations for suspected sarcoidosis include:

- **Full blood count**: often reveals leukopenia and anemia
- **Serum calcium**: may show elevated levels
- **Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)**: typically elevated; serves as a non-specific marker of disease activity and can help monitor the clinical course
- **Chest X-ray**: the primary tool for staging sarcoidosis, revealing bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, or fibrosis

Further examinations may involve a high-resolution chest CT scan if the chest X-ray is normal and bronchoscopy. The HRCT scan often reveals reticulonodular opacities with a perilymphatic distribution, particularly in the upper lung lobes. Bronchoscopy allows for mucosal visualization and obtaining transbronchial biopsies (for granuloma assessment) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sampling (showing an increased CD4:CD8 T cell ratio).

## Management (Prescribing)

Spontaneous resolution is possible in early-stage sarcoidosis. Patients with pulmonary symptoms often require corticosteroids, such as oral prednisolone or inhaled budesonide. Alternative immunosuppressants include methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, or azathioprine. Corticosteroids are also prescribed for dermatologic, ocular, and nervous system involvement.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

For end-stage lung disease (stage IV sarcoidosis and respiratory failure), lung transplantation is indicated. Sarcoidosis is the second most common reason for lung transplants in interstitial lung disease cases.

  {
    question: "A 32-year-old woman presents with a persistent dry cough and exertional dyspnea. She reports feeling fatigued and has experienced a recent weight loss of 5 kg. Physical examination reveals bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray. Which of the following clinical findings would most strongly suggest a diagnosis of sarcoidosis?",
    options: [
      "Positive tuberculin skin test",
      "Erythema nodosum and arthralgia",
      "Hemoptysis and night sweats",
      "Elevated serum creatinine",
      "Nephrotic syndrome"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Erythema nodosum and arthralgia, along with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, are part of Löfgren syndrome, which is highly indicative of sarcoidosis.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the classical presentation of sarcoidosis and its association with Löfgren syndrome. What combination of symptoms and signs is characteristic of this condition?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old male with a history of sarcoidosis presents with new-onset facial droop. He is diagnosed with a cranial nerve palsy. Which cranial nerve is most likely affected in this patient?",
    options: [
      "Optic nerve (CN II)",
      "Facial nerve (CN VII)",
      "Trigeminal nerve (CN V)",
      "Vagus nerve (CN X)",
      "Oculomotor nerve (CN III)"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Sarcoidosis can cause facial nerve (CN VII) palsy, leading to facial droop.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about the cranial nerves that could cause facial droop. Which nerve is commonly involved in facial movements?"
  },
  {
    question: "A patient with stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis is being considered for treatment. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?",
    options: [
      "Methotrexate",
      "Hydroxychloroquine",
      "Oral prednisolone",
      "Azathioprine",
      "Inhaled budesonide"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Oral prednisolone is the first-line treatment for pulmonary sarcoidosis with significant symptoms.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the standard initial treatment for symptomatic pulmonary manifestations in sarcoidosis. Which medication is most commonly used?"
  },
  {
    question: "A 28-year-old female with sarcoidosis presents with hypercalcemia. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for her elevated calcium levels?",
    options: [
      "Increased renal absorption of calcium",
      "Decreased calcitonin production",
      "Increased intestinal absorption of calcium",
      "Decreased parathyroid hormone secretion",
      "Increased bone resorption"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! In sarcoidosis, activated macrophages in granulomas produce 1-alpha hydroxylase, leading to increased intestinal absorption of calcium due to the conversion of vitamin D to its active form.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider how granulomas in sarcoidosis can affect calcium metabolism. What role does vitamin D play in this process?"
