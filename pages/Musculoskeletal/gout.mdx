# Understanding Gout: Diagnosis and Management

Gout is a medical condition characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. While hyperuricemia is necessary for gout development, it alone is insufficient. The disease primarily manifests as acute inflammatory arthritis, chronic arthritis with tophi (crystal accumulations), or uric acid nephrolithiasis. Commonly affected individuals include hypertensive, obese males aged 30-60 who consume alcohol frequently. Other susceptible groups include the elderly and patients using diuretics or calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus.

## Clinical Stages of Gout

Gout progresses through three main clinical stages:

1. **Gout Flares**: Typically monoarticular, these can become polyarticular in chronic cases, affecting mostly lower limbs and occurring at night. Triggers include alcohol, fatty foods, certain medications, or dehydration, all of which elevate serum urate levels. Symptoms include severe pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and disability.

2. **Intercritical Gout**: This asymptomatic period between flares shortens as the disease advances.

3. **Chronic Gouty Arthritis/Tophaceous Gout**: Characterized by non-painful tophi, which are accumulations of crystals.

## Diagnosis

### During a Gout Flare

- **Arthrocentesis**: Involves sampling the joint fluid for cell counts, culture, and examination under polarizing light microscopy. If MSU crystals aren't detected, diagnosis may rely on clinical criteria or imaging.

- **Clinical Diagnostic Criteria**: Factors include male gender, history of flares, rapid onset, joint redness, first metatarsal phalangeal joint involvement, cardiovascular disease, and serum urate levels above `5.88 mg/dL`. A scoring system assesses the probability of gout.

### During Intercritical or Tophaceous Gout

- **Urate Crystals**: Identification in synovial fluid.
  
- **Clinical Assessment**: Based on patient history and presentation.

**Key Diagnostic Differentiators**: The presence of urate crystals in tissues or synovial fluid distinguishes gout from other forms of arthritis. Differential diagnoses include septic arthritis, trauma, pseudogout, and cellulitis for flares, and rheumatoid arthritis, dactylitis, or osteomyelitis for tophaceous gout.

## Investigations

### Laboratory Tests

- **Synovial Fluid**: Observation of MSU crystals with polarizing light microscopy and high white blood cell count with neutrophilic predominance.
  
- **Blood Tests**: During flares, expect elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Optimal serum urate measurements should be taken two weeks post-flare.

### Imaging

- **X-ray and MRI**: Detect erosions or bone cysts suggestive of tophi.
- **Ultrasound (US)**: Identifies the "double contour sign" on cartilage and hyperechoic areas indicative of tophaceous deposits.
- **Dual-energy Computed Tomography (DECT)**: Distinguishes urate from calcium deposits in joints.

## Management

### Pharmacological Management

- **Gout Flares**: Urate-lowering therapy offers no immediate benefit during a flare.
  
  - **Oral Glucocorticoids**: For patients unsuitable for NSAIDs or intra-articular injections, with a required dose tapering post-resolution. Rebound flares are more common with glucocorticoids.
  
  - **NSAIDs**: Recommended for younger patients without renal or gastrointestinal issues. Aspirin is contraindicated.
  
  - **Colchicine**: Suitable for patients contraindicated for glucocorticoids or NSAIDs, or those using it prophylactically. Be aware of drug interactions.
  
  - **Arthrocentesis and Glucocorticoid Injection**: For patients unable to take oral medications, limited to fewer than two inflamed joints.
  
  - **IL-1 Inhibitors (e.g., Anakinra)**: For patients unresponsive to other treatments.

- **Chronic Therapy**: Essential to maintain serum urate levels below `6 mg/dL` for patients with recurrent disabling flares, chronic imaging signs, tophi, renal issues, or nephrolithiasis.

  - **Allopurinol**: The preferred urate-lowering drug. Screen Asian patients for HLA variant due to risk of adverse reactions. Avoid with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine.
  
  - **Allopurinol + Probenecid**: If target urate levels are not achieved with allopurinol alone.

### Non-Pharmacological Management

Best initiated during intercritical periods, focusing on:

- **Patient Education**
- **Trigger Avoidance**
- **Weight Management and Exercise**

*Note*: Protein-restricted diets are not advised. Reducing alcohol consumption is crucial due to its role as a primary trigger for flares.
