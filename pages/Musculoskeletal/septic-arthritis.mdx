# Comprehensive Guide to Septic Arthritis

Septic arthritis is an infection that leads to inflammation in one or more native or prosthetic joints. It can manifest as either acute or chronic. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

## Diagnosis

**Staphylococcus aureus** is the most common pathogen causing septic arthritis across all age groups. The incidence of disseminated gonococcal arthritis is approximately 2.8 cases per 100,000 person-years. This condition is increasingly seen in the elderly with multiple comorbidities and in immunosuppressed individuals. The incidence of prosthetic joint infections ranges from 1.5-2.5% for primary interventions, rising to as much as 20% for revision procedures.

### History

A thorough history is essential for patients suspected of having septic arthritis. Key risk factors include:

- **Diabetes mellitus**
- **Advanced age**
- **Previous joint damage** (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, gout, connective tissue diseases)
- **Joint surgery**
- **Hip or knee prostheses**
- **Skin infections in conjunction with joint prostheses**
- **Immunosuppression** (inherent, medication-induced, HIV, recent steroid injection, IV drug use)

### Symptoms

- Swollen joints with pain during active or passive movement
- Polyarticular involvement in some cases
- Commonly accompanied by fevers and rigors, though their absence does not rule out the diagnosis
- Bacteremia may result in prostration, vomiting, or hypotension
- Uncommon presentations include chest wall pain for sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, sternocostal, or manubrosternal arthritis, and buttock, hip, or anterior thigh pain for sacroiliac arthritis

### Clinical Signs

- Joints may appear swollen, warm, tender, and extremely painful with movement
- Effusion might be present
- The knee is most frequently affected (around 50%), followed by the hip, shoulder, ankle, and wrists
- Signs are often less pronounced in the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, IV drug users, and infections involving the spine, hip, and shoulder joints
- For prosthetic joints, symptoms may not appear until a drainage sinus develops; occasionally, pain indicates an abscess or implant loosening

Septic arthritis is often missed in children due to non-specific signs and can be confused with transient synovitis or trauma. It can occur at any age but is most common in preschool infants and toddlers, predominantly affecting the hip and knee.

## Investigations

Studies indicate that serum C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid white blood cell count, the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells, and lactate are valuable inflammatory markers for diagnosing septic arthritis.

### Blood Tests

- **Full Blood Count (FBC):** Elevated white cells
- **Inflammatory markers:** ESR and CRP can help monitor therapy response

**Synovial Fluid Examination:** Culture is the only definitive method for diagnosing an infected joint. Tests should include leukocyte count, Gram staining, and polarising microscopy to rule out crystal arthropathy (e.g., gout, pseudogout). Do not delay treatment awaiting culture results; base initial treatment on Gram stain and microscopy findings.

- **Synovial Tissue Culture:** Consider for suspected fungal or mycobacterial infections
- **Blood Cultures:** Obtain at least two to rule out bacteremia
- **Gonococcal Infection Cultures:** Collect rectal, cervical, urethral, and pharyngeal swabs if suspected
- **Immunology:** Conduct serological tests for rheumatological disorders and vasculitides as clinically indicated

### Imaging

- **Plain X-Ray:** Limited initial value; may reveal underlying osteomyelitis or joint changes later
- **Ultrasonography:** Useful for detecting early effusion
- **CT and MRI Scanning:** Most sensitive for identifying periarticular abscesses, joint effusions, and osteomyelitis. Reserved for complex cases or specific clinical scenarios like sacroiliac or sternoclavicular joint infections.

## Management

### Antibiotics

Initiate empirical antibiotic treatment before culture results are available, as early intervention is most effective. Coverage should include at least **S. aureus** and **Streptococcus spp.** Consultation with a microbiologist is advised.

- **IV Antibiotics:** Typically administered for 2-3 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics for an additional 2-4 weeks
- **Recommended Treatments:** 
  - **Flucloxacillin** for 4-6 weeks; use **clindamycin** if allergic to penicillin
  - For suspected MRSA, use **vancomycin** (or **teicoplanin**) for 4-6 weeks; extend if complicated
  - For gonococcal arthritis or Gram-negative infections, use **cefotaxime** (or **ceftriaxone**). Treat Gram-negative infections for 4-6 weeks; gonococcal infections for 2 weeks

**Note:** MRSA and penicillin-resistant Group B Streptococcal infections are on the rise. Often treated with penicillin plus gentamicin or later-generation cephalosporins.

### Non-Prescribing Management

- **Joint Drainage:** May require repeated percutaneous aspiration for unresponsive infections. Some joints, like the hip and shoulder, may need ultrasound-guided aspiration or open arthrotomy. Surgical drainage might be necessary if medical treatment fails.
- **Splinting:** Position joints functionally to support healing. Mobilize joints as soon as feasible to aid cartilage healing and prevent contractures.
- **Infected Prosthetic Joints:** Most commonly affect the elbow, shoulder, ankle, hips, and knees. Early infections (``<12 weeks`` post-implantation) are often due to skin pathogens, while late-onset infections (``>1 year``) result from hematogenous spread. Management typically involves surgical irrigation and debridement for acute infections, and 1-stage or 2-stage exchange arthroplasty for chronic cases.
