# Ottawa Ankle Rules: Guidelines for X-ray Assessment

The Ottawa Ankle Rules are clinical guidelines that help determine the necessity of X-ray examinations following ankle and foot injuries. These rules aim to minimize unnecessary imaging, thus reducing healthcare costs and patient exposure to radiation.

## Indications for Ankle X-ray

Consider ordering an ankle X-ray series if the patient presents with pain in the malleolar zone, accompanied by any of the following criteria:

- **Bone tenderness** at the posterior edge or tip of the lateral malleolus **OR**
- **Bone tenderness** at the posterior edge or tip of the medial malleolus **OR**
- An inability to bear weight both immediately after the injury and in the emergency department for four steps

## Indications for Foot X-ray

A foot X-ray series should be considered if there is pain in the midfoot zone along with any of the following:

- **Bone tenderness** at the base of the fifth metatarsal **OR**
- **Bone tenderness** at the navicular bone **OR**
- An inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department for four steps

## Clinical Judgement Considerations

Apply clinical judgement in the following scenarios, as the Ottawa Ankle Rules may not be entirely applicable:

- The patient is **intoxicated** or **uncooperative**
- The presence of other **distracting injuries**
- **Diminished sensation** in the legs
- **Gross swelling** that hinders palpation of the malleolar bone

**Note:** "Bearing weight" is considered valid even if the patient is limping. These rules are applicable for individuals aged 2 years and older.
