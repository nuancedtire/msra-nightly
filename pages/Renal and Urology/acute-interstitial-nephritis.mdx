# Acute Interstitial Nephritis: An Overview

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is a kidney disorder characterized by inflammation of the kidney's interstitial tissue. It can result from allergic reactions to certain medications, infections, or systemic diseases. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the causes, diagnosis, investigations, management, and monitoring of AIN.

## Causes of Acute Interstitial Nephritis

AIN is most commonly induced by allergic reactions to medications but can also be attributed to infections or systemic conditions. Here are some common causative agents and conditions:

- **Medications**
  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
  - Diuretics
  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
  - Antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and sulphonamides

- **Systemic Diseases**
  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  - Sarcoidosis
  - Sjogren’s syndrome

It's critical to note that AIN might emerge days or even weeks after the initiation of an offending drug.

## Clinical Presentation

Symptoms of AIN can manifest abruptly or develop over time. Typical signs include:

- Painless haematuria
- Sterile pyuria
- Flank and loin pain
- Rash, which may indicate drug hypersensitivity
- Fever
- Arthralgia, suggesting drug hypersensitivity
- Eosinophilia
- Nocturia
- Oliguria

## Diagnostic Investigations

For patients suspected of having AIN, the following diagnostic steps should be taken:

### Urinalysis
A nephrotic picture may be evident, characterized by:
- Proteinuria
- Haematuria (*without* red blood cell casts, which are seen in glomerulonephritis)
- Sterile pyuria
- White blood cell casts

### Blood Tests
Routine blood work may reveal:
- Elevated urea and creatinine levels
- Eosinophilia
- Increased alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, particularly with drug-induced cases

### Imaging and Biopsy
While not commonly performed, a renal biopsy can confirm AIN. Renal ultrasound may show enlarged kidneys due to allergic reactions but is not a routine procedure.

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Measures
- Discontinuation of the offending drug often leads to improved renal function, although NSAIDs are associated with a poorer prognosis.
- Corticosteroid therapy can expedite recovery, especially when AIN is due to an autoimmune disease or allergic reaction.
- Addressing any underlying disorder or infection is a priority.

**Note:** Stopping the offending medication is crucial for recovery.

### Non-Prescribing Measures
- Dialysis may be necessary in severe cases.
- Some patients might suffer irreversible renal damage, necessitating a kidney transplant.

**Tip:** Regular monitoring of kidney function is essential to assess treatment response and progression.

## Ongoing Monitoring

Patients with AIN should undergo frequent renal function tests to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and monitor for potential progression to chronic kidney disease.
