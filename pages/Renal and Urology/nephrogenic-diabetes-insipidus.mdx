# Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus: An Overview

## Introduction

Diabetes Insipidus (DI) is a condition characterized by the excretion of copious amounts of diluted urine with low osmolality (`<300 mOsmol/kg`), typically exceeding `3L` per day in adults and `2L` per day in children. This condition arises when the balance of water in the body is disrupted. Normally, increased blood sodium levels prompt thirst and the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which collectively act to lower serum osmolality. ADH specifically enhances water reabsorption in the kidney's collecting tubules.

Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI) occurs when the kidneys become insensitive to ADH, whereas Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) results from inadequate ADH release by the posterior pituitary gland. NDI is less common than CDI and can be either acquired or hereditary. Chronic lithium therapy is the most recognized acquired cause of NDI, with about 30% of patients on lithium developing the condition.

## Diagnosis of Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus

**Common Causes of NDI:**

- **Lithium Therapy:** Interferes with aquaporin 2 channel expression.
- **Hypercalcaemia:** Disrupts the countercurrent mechanism, affecting water reabsorption.
- **Hypokalaemia:** Results in mild NDI, though the exact mechanism is not well-understood.

**Other Less Common Causes:**

- Sickle cell disease trait
- Renal amyloidosis
- Sjögren’s syndrome
- Post-obstructive uropathy
- Certain medications, such as vasopressin receptor antagonists

**Hereditary NDI:**

- Typically involves mutations in the ADH receptor or aquaporin 2 channel genes.
- Approximately 90% of these cases are X-linked.
- Conditions like Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Bartter syndrome can also present with NDI.
- Symptoms often manifest in infancy, though some forms may appear in adulthood.

**Symptoms:**

- Polyuria, including nocturia (due to high ADH levels during sleep)
- Polydipsia (excessive thirst)
- Additional symptoms related to underlying causes (e.g., Lithium toxicity, hypercalcaemia)

## Investigative Procedures

The initial assessment for DI involves parallel measurements of Plasma osmolality and Urine osmolality. Typical findings in DI include high plasma osmolality paired with low urine osmolality.

- Urine osmolality `<300 mOsmol/kg` is indicative of DI.
- Urine osmolality `>700 mOsmol/kg` rules out DI.
- If results fall between these values, further investigation is warranted.

The **water deprivation test** serves as the gold standard for diagnosing DI. Patients are instructed to abstain from water until a specific plasma osmolality is reached. Subsequently, desmopressin is administered to differentiate between types of DI:

- Normal urine osmolality post-test (`>700 mOsmol/kg`) excludes DI.
- If urine osmolality `<300` and desmopressin doubles it (`>300`), CDI is diagnosed.
- Minimal or no change after desmopressin indicates NDI.

For NDI, it is crucial to measure calcium, potassium, and lithium levels accordingly.

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Interventions

- **Address the Underlying Cause:** Treat the primary disorder or discontinue the offending agent.
- **Symptom Management:**
  - Thiazide diuretics are the first-line prescription, promoting water and sodium reabsorption by inducing hypovolaemia.
  - Amiloride may be added if polyuria persists.
  - NSAIDs, particularly Indomethacin, can be used to inhibit prostaglandins that counteract ADH.
  - A trial of desmopressin may help patients with partial ADH resistance.

### Non-prescribing Measures

- **Hydration:** Ensuring adequate water intake is critical to avoid complications like hypernatremia and dehydration.
- **Dietary Adjustments:** A low-salt and low-protein diet helps reduce solute excretion and consequent water loss.
- **Double Voiding:** This technique is recommended for children with hereditary NDI to prevent bladder damage.
