# Interstitial Nephritis: Overview, Diagnosis, and Management

Interstitial nephritis, also known as tubulointerstitial nephritis, is characterized by inflammation within the interstitium of the kidneys. There are two primary forms of the condition: acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN). Between 40-60% of cases result from medication-induced hypersensitivity reactions. Other causes can be infections or autoimmune disorders. Prompt cessation of the causative medication is crucial and often the most effective treatment.

## Acute vs. Chronic Interstitial Nephritis

### Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN)

- **Incidence**: Accounts for 6.5-15% of acute kidney injury cases.
- **Etiology**: Largely drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions.
- **Clinical Presentation**:
  - Fatigue
  - Loss of appetite 
  - Nausea/vomiting
  - Fever
  - Rash
  - Eosinophilia
  - Elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels

<Callout emoji="ℹ️">
**Note:** The 'hypersensitivity triad' of rash, fever, and eosinophilia is seen in fewer than 10% of patients.
</Callout>

- **Drug-induced Causes**:
  - Beta-lactam antibiotics: `2-60 days` post-treatment initiation
  - Fluoroquinolone antibiotics
  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Often months into treatment
  - Proton-pump inhibitors
  - Certain diuretics (thiazides, furosemide, triamterene)
  - Cancer immunotherapy agents
- **Infectious Causes**:
  - Septicaemia
  - Pyelonephritis
- **Viral Causes**:
  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
  - Hantavirus
  - HIV
- **Immune Disorders**:
  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  - Sarcoidosis
  - Sjögren’s syndrome

### Chronic Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (CTIN)

- **Incidence**: A common cause of kidney failure in the western world.
- **Etiology**: Often due to long-term analgesic use.
- **Age Group**: Typically affects individuals between `30-70 years`.
- **Clinical Presentation**:
  - Flank pain
  - Hematuria
  - Hypertension
  - Anemia
  - Proteinuria

- **Causes**:
  - Medications like 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), Chinese herbs, lithium
  - Radiation exposure
  - Immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin
  - Heavy metal exposure: Lead, cadmium
  - Neoplastic conditions: Myeloma, amyloidosis, leukemia
  - Immune disorders: SLE, sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, vasculitides
  - Genetic disorders: Medullary cystic disease, Alport’s syndrome
  - Metabolic disorders: Chronic hypokalemia, hyperoxaluria, hypercalcemia, chronic urate nephropathy

## Diagnostic Investigations

- Urinalysis: Detects hematuria/proteinuria.
- Serum assays: Elevated IgE and creatinine levels.
- Eosinophilia/eosinophiluria assessment.
- Anemia detection in CTIN.
- Pregnancy test for women of reproductive age.
- Imaging:
  - High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT): Normal or enlarged kidneys in AIN; reduced renal volume and irregular contours in CTIN.
  - Ultrasound: Increased cortical echogenicity in AIN; potential hydronephrosis in CTIN.

**Important:** A definitive diagnosis often requires a kidney biopsy.
</Callout>

## Management Strategies

### Prescribing Interventions

- **Primary Treatment**: Cease offending medications.
- **Steroid Therapy**: High-dose steroids like prednisolone may improve kidney function recovery in AIN.
- **Blood Pressure Control**:
  - Prescribe antihypertensive medication, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
  - Avoid combining ACE-inhibitors and ARBs.
  - Contraindicated during pregnancy.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
**Warning:** Drug choices should align with local guidelines and contraindications.
</Callout>

### Non-Prescribing Interventions

- Discontinue any potential hypersensitivity-inducing drugs.
- Lifestyle adjustments:
  - Regular exercise
  - Weight management
  - Salt-reduced diet
- Severe CTIN cases: Consider dialysis or kidney transplantation.

<MCQGroup questions={[
  {
    question: "A 45-year-old male presents with fatigue, nausea, and a rash. Lab tests reveal eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels. He started taking a new medication two months ago for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Which medication is most likely responsible for these findings?",
    options: [
      "Metformin",
      "Omeprazole",
      "Atorvastatin",
      "Lisinopril",
      "Metoprolol"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! Proton-pump inhibitors like omeprazole can cause acute interstitial nephritis, which may present as a hypersensitivity reaction with fatigue, nausea, rash, eosinophilia, and elevated IgE levels.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Think about which medications are associated with hypersensitivity reactions and acute interstitial nephritis. Recall the common medications used for gastroesophageal reflux disease."
  },
  {
    question: "A 60-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and chronic lower back pain presents with elevated creatinine levels and anemia. A kidney biopsy is performed, which shows interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy without acute inflammation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    options: [
      "Acute interstitial nephritis",
      "Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis",
      "Acute glomerulonephritis",
      "Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis",
      "Diabetic nephropathy"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    correctFeedback: "Correct! The patient's history of chronic pain management and the biopsy findings of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy suggest chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, likely due to long-term analgesic use.",
    incorrectFeedback: "Consider the chronicity of symptoms, history of medication use, and the biopsy findings. Which condition is consistent with non-inflammatory chronic kidney damage?"
