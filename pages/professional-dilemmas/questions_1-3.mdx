import RankingQuestion from '@/components/RankingQuestion'

### Question 1

Your consultant Dr Jackson has asked you to prescribe a second antibiotic for a patient who has a chest infection which has been slow to respond to initial treatment. Later that day, a pharmacist informs you that the new antibiotic is not in the hospital formulary. She tells you that the new antibiotic should not be used because of the risk of clostridium difficile infection.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  ]}
  correctExplanation="Contacting your consultant (Option C) is the most appropriate action, as it respects the consultant's role and ensures that all relevant information is considered in patient care decisions. Explaining that the consultant requested the antibiotic (Option B) is also appropriate, but it places the responsibility on the pharmacist. Asking your specialty trainee to review the patient (Option D) is a good idea, but it should be done after consulting your consultant. Prescribing what the pharmacist advises (Option A) without discussing with your consultant may not be the best course of action, as it bypasses the consultant's expertise. Not changing the prescription and merely noting the pharmacist's concerns (Option E) is the least appropriate action, as it ignores potential risks to patient safety."

**If you ranked Option B lower**

Reflect on the importance of involving relevant team members in patient care decisions and ensuring that concerns are addressed.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Think about the potential risks to patient safety if concerns raised by colleagues are not promptly and appropriately addressed.

<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your consultant insists on the new antibiotic despite the pharmacist's concerns?**

This could be a challenging situation. You could consider discussing the issue with a more senior colleague or the medical director. Ultimately, patient safety should be your priority.

**What if the pharmacist is unable to explain why the new antibiotic should not be used?**

You could ask the pharmacist to clarify her concerns, or you could seek advice from another pharmacist or a more senior colleague. It's important to understand the reasons behind any advice you're given.

**What if you're unsure about the risks associated with the new antibiotic?**

You should seek further information or advice from a more knowledgeable source, such as a pharmacist, a more senior colleague, or a reliable medical resource. It's important to make informed decisions about patient care.

### Question 2

On the morning ward round, your specialty trainee\* mentioned that Mrs. Anderson is medically fit following her total knee replacement and could be discharged if Occupational Therapy\* feels it is appropriate. The occupational therapist has assessed Mrs. Anderson and believes it is safe for her to go home with a care package that has been arranged. It is now 4pm and the nurse informs you that Mrs. Anderson is demanding to see a doctor as she does not feel that she is ready to go home yet. An elective admission is waiting in the day room for Mrs. Anderson's bed.

    'Think about the implications of bed allocation on patient perception and satisfaction.',
    'Reflect on the need to balance efficient resource use with patient-centered care.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Understanding Mrs. Anderson's concerns (Option A) is the first step to reassuring her that it is safe for her to go home. The occupational therapist, who has more experience in addressing anxieties over discharge safety (Option E), could be involved next. If needed, your senior colleague (Option B) can assist in managing Mrs. Anderson's concerns. It may be appropriate to request a different bed for the elective patient from the bed manager (Option C) if Mrs. Anderson's discharge is delayed. However, coercing Mrs. Anderson to go home by suggesting she is depriving another patient of a bed (Option D) is inappropriate as it does not address her concerns."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Consider the impact of coercing a patient to go home on their perception of care and their trust in the healthcare system. Reflect on the importance of understanding and addressing patient concerns.

**If you ranked Option B higher than A or E**

While seeking senior advice is valuable, consider whether you can first address the issue directly with the patient or involve the occupational therapist to promote effective communication and patient-centered care.

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Think about the balance between efficient resource use and patient-centered care. Patient concerns should be addressed before considering bed re-allocation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Mrs. Anderson becomes uncooperative when you try to discuss her concerns?**

Remain professional and empathetic. Involve the occupational therapist who may be able to address her concerns effectively. If necessary, seek guidance from a senior colleague.

**What if Mrs. Anderson has valid concerns about her home environment that were not previously addressed?**

Discuss these concerns with the occupational therapist and consider reassessing her discharge plan. The patient's safety at home is a key consideration for discharge.

**What if the elective patient is becoming increasingly anxious and frustrated?**

Explain the situation without breaching Mrs. Anderson's confidentiality. Assure them that the team is working to resolve the situation as quickly and safely as possible.

### Question 3

You are working on a busy paediatric ward. Your shift was meant to finish at 7pm, but it is now 9pm on a Friday, and you are still trying to complete some of your routine tasks from the day. This has happened on a number of occasions in the last month and you feel exhausted as a result. Your workload is also having a negative impact on your social life.

Finishing on time indicates a balanced and achievable workload and contributes to good work-life balance (Option C). While receiving a poor reference may be personally important, it should not have a direct or immediate impact on patient care (Option D). Disappointing friends (Option E) should not influence decisions on the ward as it does not affect the level of patient care."
