### Question 13

You are working on a respiratory ward. This ward is attached to a nationally acclaimed academic department. There are posters advertising research projects in all patient care areas. You overhear a patient telling a relative that he is concerned that his personal information will be used in research and made available for all to see.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

    'Reflect on the importance of discussing concerns with the patient, not just their relatives.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="By asking the patient about his concerns (Option C), you can provide specific and relevant reassurance, demonstrating respect for his views and concerns. It's important to reassure the patient (Option D) about the use of his personal information in research, respecting his autonomy and privacy. Providing communication to all patients (Option B) is a good step, but it does not directly address the patient's immediate concerns. Telling the nurse what you overheard (Option A) delegates responsibility and may not address the patient's concern in a timely manner. Informing the relative (Option E) doesn't directly address the patient's concerns, which is least appropriate."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider the importance of taking responsibility for addressing patient concerns directly, rather than delegating to others.

**If you ranked Option B higher than C or D**

While providing clear information to all patients is crucial, consider the importance of addressing immediate patient concerns directly.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Reflect on the importance of discussing concerns directly with the patient, rather than only their relatives.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if the patient still has concerns after your reassurances?**

Consider involving other members of the healthcare team who can provide further reassurance, such as the ward manager or a research ethics liaison.

**What if you are unsure about the hospital's policy on using patient information in research?**

Seek advice from a senior colleague or the research department to gain accurate knowledge that you can share with the patient.

**What if other patients express similar concerns?**

This could indicate a wider issue with communication about research in the ward. Consider discussing with the ward manager about ways to improve information provision and reassure patients.

### Question 14

It is 8am and you have just finished a busy night shift on the Acute Admissions Unit (AAU). Mr Dean, a patient on your ward with acute renal failure, needs his blood tests to be re-checked in four hours’ time. You approach Gerard, your FY1 colleague, who is starting his shift on your ward. You attempt to hand over the information relating to Mr Dean’s case to ensure that the blood tests are carried out. Gerard says angrily that he has a long list of other patients to see and has just been called to an emergency situation on another ward. He refuses to accept your handover.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate).**

    {
      id: 'A',

  correctExplanation="Explaining to Gerard that he is now responsible for patients on the ward (Option B) enhances communication and demonstrates appropriate assertiveness. Handing the task to another doctor (Option C) ensures the task will be completed in the patient’s best interests. Leaving written information about a patient in their clinical record (Option D) is acceptable, but does not ensure that the task will be completed. Informing a nurse (Option E) is less reliable as it does not clearly handover the responsibility. Taking the blood test yourself (Option A) ensures it is taken, but risks errors due to fatigue."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider the risks of fatigue and how it can lead to mistakes. Reflect on the importance of rest and not exceeding your limits.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Reflect on the importance of clear and specific handovers. Nurses may not know which doctor to contact and this may delay important tasks.

**If you ranked Option D lower**

While leaving detailed instructions is important for continuity of care, it does not guarantee that the task will be done. Consider how you can ensure tasks are completed.

<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Gerard continues to refuse your handover?**

You should escalate this to a senior colleague or supervisor. It's important to maintain patient safety and care.

**What if there are no other doctors available for the handover?**

You should escalate this to nursing staff or a senior colleague. It's important to ensure that important tasks, like Mr Dean's blood tests, are not missed.

**What if you are too tired to find another doctor for the handover?**

You should ask a nurse or another available colleague for help. Remember that patient safety is the priority and important tasks should not be missed.

### Question 15

You are admitting a patient who does not speak fluent English for an elective operation. He does not have a translator or a relative present. You know from his notes that the patient speaks Urdu. It is apparent that his pain has worsened since his clinic appointment. You ask the patient how long he has been suffering from this pain. The patient appears to understand what you are saying but cannot reply. He is clinically stable.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1=Most appropriate; 5=Least appropriate).**

    'Think about the role of qualified translators in healthcare.',
    'Reflect on the importance of seeking advice when faced with difficulties.',
    'Consider the patient’s autonomy and right to understand his condition and treatment.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="The most appropriate action is to ask an Urdu-speaking doctor for assistance (Option A), as this provides direct and fluent communication with the patient. If this isn't possible, obtaining a qualified translator through NHS language services (Option C) is the next best step. As the patient's clinical care could be compromised by communication difficulties, consulting a senior doctor (Option D) is also appropriate. Involving the patient’s next of kin (Option E) should be done with caution due to potential confidentiality issues. Simply continuing without taking any alternative action is not good clinical care (Option B)."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option B higher**

Consider the limitations of continuing communication attempts without seeking alternative solutions. Reflect on the importance of effective communication in clinical care.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Consider the potential confidentiality issues when involving relatives without the patient's consent. Reflect on the importance of patient autonomy and confidentiality.

**If you ranked Option D lower**

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if an Urdu-speaking doctor is not available?**

In this case, obtaining a qualified translator becomes the most appropriate option. If this isn't immediately possible, you may need to seek advice from a senior doctor.

**What if the patient's pain worsens to a critical level?**

Immediate medical intervention may be required. In this case, involving a senior doctor becomes a priority to ensure patient safety.

**What if the patient’s relatives insist on being involved in the conversation?**

Patient confidentiality and consent are crucial. You should seek the patient's consent before sharing information with relatives, considering also the appropriateness of the information to be shared, and seek advice from a senior colleague if unsure.
