### Question 10

You joined a new team three months ago, and you work with two specialty trainees, Anne and Emma, and an FY2 colleague, Malakai. You notice that the team works well when Anne is present, but when Anne is on leave or absent from the workplace, Emma and Malakai become very dominant and often undermine your decisions in front of patients.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1=Most appropriate; 5=Least appropriate).**

  ]}
  correctExplanation="Discussing your concerns with the whole team (Option B) is the most appropriate action, as it promotes open communication and addresses the issue directly. Seeking advice from a senior colleague (Option A) can provide valuable guidance, but it does not directly involve the team members in question. Documenting the behaviour (Option D) may be useful for reflection, but it is less proactive than the first two options. Waiting for improvement without action (Option E) can delay resolution and potentially exacerbate the issue. Requesting a team change (Option C) avoids addressing the issue directly and does not promote learning or resolution, making it the least appropriate option."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider the importance of direct communication in addressing conflicts. While seeking senior advice is valuable, it's also essential to involve the team members in question.

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Think about the role of documentation in resolving conflicts. Although it's crucial, it's also essential to take proactive steps to address the issue.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Reflect on the potential consequences of passive waiting. Delayed resolution can lead to worsening of the situation.

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider the implications of requesting a team change without addressing the issue. It's crucial to take responsibility and attempt to resolve conflicts directly.

<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your team members do not respond positively to your discussion?**

You might need to involve a senior colleague or seek advice from HR. Remember, it's essential to maintain professionalism and focus on the common goal of patient care.

**What if the behaviour of Emma and Malakai continues despite your efforts?**

In such a case, documenting the instances and escalating the issue might become necessary. It's important to ensure a safe and respectful working environment for all team members.

**What if Anne returns and the team dynamics improve?**

This might be a good opportunity to discuss the issue with Anne and seek her perspective. Continual improvement of team dynamics is essential for effective patient care.

### Question 11

You work on the Breast Surgery unit. Due to recent advances in surgical techniques, the inpatient stay has dropped from five days to an overnight stay. Consequently, you seem to spend all your time clerking in patients and the number of learning opportunities has reduced as a result.

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on the importance of balancing additional responsibilities with current commitments. How would taking on a position in the junior doctors' committee affect your time and ability to fulfill your responsibilities in the Breast Surgery unit?

**If you ranked Option B higher**

Consider the implications of a drastic action like requesting a move to another unit. Could there be other ways to address the lack of learning opportunities within your current team?

**If you ranked Option D higher than C**

While assisting colleagues on other wards is a demonstration of good teamwork, how might it directly benefit your assigned team? Reflect on the importance of contributing to your current team and seeking learning opportunities within it.

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your consultant does not allow you to support outpatient clinics and theatre sessions?**

Consider other ways to increase your learning opportunities within the team, such as participating in team discussions, studying recent advances in Breast Surgery, or requesting a job review to include more learning elements.

**What if your FY1 colleagues on other wards do not need assistance?**

Reflect on the importance of seeking learning opportunities within your current team. Could you request to support outpatient clinics or theatre sessions? Could the job be reviewed to include more learning elements?

**What if the Foundation Programme Director agrees to review the job but the changes will take time to implement?**

Consider ways to increase your learning opportunities in the meantime, such as supporting outpatient clinics and theatre sessions, assisting colleagues on other wards, or taking on additional responsibilities if they do not interfere with your current commitments.

### Question 12

You've reached the end of your shift, but have agreed to stay on the ward for an additional hour due to unforeseen circumstances. A patient, Mr Griffin, is admitted to the ward from the Acute Admissions Unit (AAU). You notice that Mr Griffin does not have a drug chart or management plan, which should have been completed upon admission.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

      principle: 'Domain 4: Trust & Professionalism - Ensuring clear communication about patient care is key, but this option may lack immediate follow-up.',

      principle: 'Domain 3: Colleagues, Culture & Safety - Clear handover is essential to maintain continuity of care.',

      principle: 'Domain 2: Patients, Partnership & Communication - Involving senior doctors can help address complex or urgent issues.',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['A', 'D', 'B', 'E', 'C']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the importance of ensuring immediate and effective patient care.',
    'Reflect on the effectiveness of communication in each option.',
    'Think about the appropriate delegation of tasks within the healthcare team.',
    'Consider the risks associated with delayed or missing documentation.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Contacting the AAU (Option A) allows you to get necessary information and make an informed decision about the patient's care. Doing a proper handover to the night-shift FY1 (Option D) ensures continuity of care. Asking the nurse in charge (Option B) could help, but it may not be as reliable as direct doctor-to-doctor communication. Informing a senior doctor (Option E) could be helpful, but they may have other higher priority tasks. Sending a message to the next shift doctor (Option C) is least appropriate as it lacks immediate follow-up and could risk patient safety."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option B higher**

Reflect on the importance of direct doctor-to-doctor communication to ensure patient safety. Why did you think delegating this to the nurse was more appropriate?

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Why did you think sending a message without immediate follow-up was appropriate? Consider the potential risks to patient safety with this approach.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Consider why you felt involving a senior doctor was necessary in this situation. Could the issue have been resolved at your level, or through direct communication with the AAU?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if you are unable to reach the AAU?**

Consider other ways to get the needed information, such as discussing with the nurse in charge or handing over to the night shift doctor.

**What if the night shift doctor is busy with another urgent case when you try to handover?**

Prioritise patient safety. You may need to wait for an appropriate moment or involve a senior doctor if necessary.

**What if there are multiple patients admitted without the correct paperwork?**

This may indicate a systemic issue that needs to be addressed. Consider discussing the situation with a senior doctor or ward management.
