### Question 22

You are on your way to add a patient to an emergency theatre list urgently when a nurse approaches you and says that he is concerned about one of your patients, Mr Benn. Mr Benn’s catheter is showing a very low urine output following his surgery earlier that morning. You had already checked on Mr Benn during your ward round two hours previously and had seen that his urine output was adequate given his body size.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate).**

  correctExplanation="Asking the nurse about changes since the ward round (Option E) provides more recent information and acknowledges the nurse’s concerns. Asking the nurse to record vital signs while you complete your current task (Option D) ensures patient safety while managing tasks effectively. Going straight to review Mr Benn (Option B) shows concern for patient safety but fails to consider task prioritization. Asking the nurse to find another doctor (Option C) improperly delegates responsibility. Simply reassuring the nurse (Option A) dismisses the new concern, potentially missing valuable information."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on the potential negative impact of dismissing new observations about a patient’s condition. How can you effectively communicate with the nursing staff to ensure all relevant information is considered?

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider the potential consequences of delegating responsibility for your patient to another team member. How can you manage your tasks effectively while ensuring the safety of all your patients?

**If you ranked Option B higher**

Reflect on the balance between addressing new patient concerns and completing immediate tasks. How can you prioritize effectively in a high-pressure situation?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if the nurse reports that Mr Benn’s condition has deteriorated significantly?**

In this scenario, Mr Benn’s condition may need immediate attention. You could ask the nurse to check vital signs and alert a senior colleague while you address the emergency theatre list.

**What if multiple nurses voice concerns about different patients while you are addressing the emergency theatre list?**

This may indicate a larger issue on the ward. It would be appropriate to seek immediate senior assistance while you continue to address the emergency theatre list.

**What if the nurse is unable to check vital signs or find another team member?**

This scenario further complicates the situation. It would be important to quickly reassess the potential risks to all patients involved and consider seeking immediate senior help.

### Question 23

You are working on a medical ward. You notice that one of your FY1 colleagues on the ward,
Bashar, is not completing his assigned tasks. You often find him in the staff room on his
mobile phone when he should be completing his tasks on the ward.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

<RankingQuestion
  question=""
  options={[
    {
      id: 'A',
      text: 'Accept that it is not your place to intervene',
      principle: 'Domain 4: Trust & Professionalism - Doctors must never overlook or ignore situations that can impact patient care or safety.',
    },
    {
      id: 'B',
      text: 'Ensure that you cover any tasks Bashar fails to complete',
      principle: 'Domain 1: Knowledge, Skills & Development - Doctors must deliver patient care as a first priority, including when colleagues are unable to fulfil their duties.',
    },
    {
      id: 'C',
      text: 'Discuss this with your educational supervisor at the end of the placement',
      principle: 'Domain 3: Colleagues, Culture & Safety - Raising concerns about colleagues should be done promptly and not delayed until the end of a placement.',
    },
    {
      id: 'D',
      text: 'Ask Bashar why he is often in the staff room rather than on the ward',
      principle: 'Domain 2: Patients, Partnerships & Communication - Addressing issues directly with colleagues can help identify problems and find solutions.',
    },
    {
      id: 'E',
      text: 'Inform a senior colleague of your concerns',
      principle: 'Domain 3: Colleagues, Culture & Safety - Doctors should report concerns about colleagues who are not fulfilling their duties to ensure patient safety and quality of care.',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['D', 'E', 'B', 'C', 'A']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the importance of addressing issues directly with colleagues.',
    'Reflect on your responsibilities towards patient care and safety.',
    'Think about the appropriate channels for raising concerns about colleagues.',
    'Consider the impact of ignoring or delaying addressing the issue.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Speaking directly to Bashar (Option D) is the most appropriate initial action as it allows you to understand the situation and possibly find a resolution. If this does not resolve the issue, informing a senior colleague (Option E) ensures that those with more authority are aware of the problem. Covering the tasks Bashar fails to complete (Option B) ensures patient care is not compromised, but it does not address the root of the problem. Discussing the issue with your educational supervisor at the end of the placement (Option C) delays addressing the problem and risks ongoing impact on patient care. Accepting that it is not your place to intervene (Option A) is the least appropriate action as it overlooks a situation that could impact patient care."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on your responsibility to ensure patient safety and quality of care. Ignoring or overlooking issues can have a detrimental impact on these aspects. How might you approach this situation differently in the future?

**If you ranked Option B higher than D or E**

While ensuring patient care is important, covering for Bashar does not address the root of the problem. Reflect on the importance of identifying and resolving issues within the team. How might you balance patient care with addressing collegial issues?

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider the implications of delaying addressing an issue until the end of a placement. How might this impact patient care, team dynamics, and Bashar's performance? 

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Bashar becomes defensive when you approach him?**

Remain professional and explain your concerns focusing on patient care and team efficiency. If unresolved, consider involving a senior colleague.

**What if Bashar continues to neglect his tasks despite your conversation and reporting to a senior colleague?**

This could signify a more serious issue. It may be necessary to involve your educational supervisor or even higher authorities within the institution to ensure patient care is not compromised.

**What if other staff members are also neglecting their tasks?**

This could indicate a systemic issue within the ward. Consider raising this with a senior colleague or your educational supervisor, so that appropriate measures can be taken to improve the situation.

### Question 24

You are an FY1 working on a general medical ward. As you return to the ward from your break, you overhear your FY1 colleague, Clare, speaking to one of the healthcare assistants, Melissa, in the corridor. Clare tells Melissa angrily that she needs to improve her skills if she is ever to be any good at her job. Melissa looks visibly upset, apologises to Clare then walks away. You have witnessed Clare talking in a similar way to other colleagues in the past.

**Rank in order the extent to which you agree with the following statements in this situation (1 = Most agree with; 5 = Least agree with).**

<RankingQuestion
  question=""
  options={[
    {
      id: 'A',
      text: 'Melissa needs to learn to accept feedback from other members of the team',
      principle: 'Domain 2: Patient, Partnership & Communication - Constructive feedback is part of professional development, but the delivery is crucial.',
    },
    {
      id: 'B',
      text: 'It is not your responsibility to speak to Clare about her behaviour',
      principle: 'Domain 4: Trust & Professionalism - Doctors should be proactive in addressing issues that impact team dynamics and respectful communication.',
    },
    {
      id: 'C',
      text: 'Clare should not be speaking to members of staff in this manner',
      principle: 'Domain 3: Colleagues, Culture & Safety - Respectful communication is fundamental to a positive work environment and patient care.',
    },
    {
      id: 'D',
      text: 'Melissa should inform a senior colleague if she has been upset by Clare',
      principle: 'Domain 4: Trust & Professionalism - Reporting disrespectful behaviour is key to maintaining a professional work environment.',
    },
    {
      id: 'E',
      text: 'Clare needs to be held accountable for her behaviour',
      principle: 'Domain 4: Trust & Professionalism - Any form of unprofessional behaviour should be addressed and individuals held accountable.',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['C', 'E', 'D', 'A', 'B']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the principles of respectful communication and teamwork.',
    'Reflect on the responsibilities of all individuals to uphold professional behaviour.',
    'Think about the role of feedback in professional development.',
    'Contemplate the importance of addressing issues that disrupt a positive work environment.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Clare's disrespectful manner (Option C) is unacceptable and goes against the principles of respectful communication and teamwork. She should be held accountable for her behaviour (Option E) to prevent recurrence and maintain a positive work environment. If Melissa is upset, she should inform a senior colleague (Option D) as they can provide support and initiate necessary actions. While feedback is important for professional development (Option A), it needs to be delivered in a constructive manner. As a doctor, it is your responsibility to address unprofessional behaviour (Option B), especially when it impacts the team dynamics and work environment."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on the difference between constructive feedback and disrespectful communication. How might this impact the receiver's ability to learn and improve?

**If you ranked Option B higher**

Consider your responsibilities as a doctor in fostering a respectful and professional work environment. How would ignoring unprofessional behaviour impact this?

**If you ranked Option C or E lower**

Think about the potential consequences of disrespectful communication on team dynamics and patient care. How does holding individuals accountable contribute to a positive work environment?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Clare is your senior and you feel uncomfortable addressing her behaviour?**

Reflect on the importance of respectful communication regardless of seniority. If you feel uncomfortable, consider discussing the situation with another senior colleague or your supervisor.

**What if Melissa does not want to escalate the situation?**

Even if Melissa does not want to escalate, it is important to address Clare's behaviour to prevent it from affecting others. You can support Melissa and offer to help her report the incident.

**What if Clare's behaviour does not change despite your intervention?**

If Clare's behaviour does not change, the issue may need to be escalated to higher management. It is crucial to maintain a respectful and professional work environment for effective patient care.
