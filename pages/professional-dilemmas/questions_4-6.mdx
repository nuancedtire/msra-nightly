### Question 4

You are working on the Surgical ward and you are about to attend theatre to observe your consultant undertake a complicated procedure. This will be a good learning opportunity for you and you anticipate being in theatre for about two hours. As you are about to leave the ward, one of the nurses tells you that a patient needs to have her medication reviewed prior to receiving her next dose in three hours’ time. He tells you that he believes one of the other FY1 doctors has been making prescription errors. You also notice one of the patients on the ward beckon you over to his bed urgently. You know from experience that the patient often just wants to have someone to talk to as he gets lonely.

**Rank in order the tasks that should be undertaken (1= Do first; 5= Do last).**

Attending theatre (Option C) is a good learning opportunity that will help you deliver better patient care. Investigating the nurse’s concerns about prescription errors (Option D) is important, but not immediately urgent. Spending time with a patient (Option E) is desirable but can be done by others if necessary and should be considered after addressing other tasks."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider the importance of prioritizing patient safety and immediate concerns over learning opportunities. Reflect on the potential impact of medication errors and patient questions.

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Think about the urgency of investigating the nurse's allegations. While it's important to address such concerns, immediate patient needs and safety issues should take precedence.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Reflect on the importance of addressing immediate patient needs and safety concerns. While spending time with patients is important, it should be balanced with other priorities.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if the patient beckoning you is in pain or distress?**

Immediate attention should be given to the patient, and you should seek assistance from clinical staff as required. Patient safety and comfort should always be prioritized.

**What if the nurse's allegations are about you making prescription errors?**

You should immediately review your practice and seek advice from a senior colleague. Reflect on your prescribing habits and consider additional training if necessary.

**What if the theatre procedure is a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity?**

While learning opportunities are important, patient safety and immediate concerns should be prioritized. Consider discussing this with a senior colleague to explore possible solutions.

### Question 5

It is 6pm and you are clerking a patient who is to undergo an elective splenectomy the next morning. Before he left, your consultant asked you to prescribe the antibiotics and immunisations that need to be given that evening so that surgery can proceed tomorrow. You now cannot find the folder containing the pre-operative protocols and it is not available on the intranet. Your consultant has already gone home.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  correctOrder={['E', 'A', 'B', 'D', 'C']}
  hints={[
    'Consider who would be the most knowledgeable about the hospital and consultant\'s policies.',
    'Reflect on the importance of referring to reliable sources for clinical guidance.',
    'Evaluate the urgency of the situation and the need for timely action.',
    'Consider the roles and responsibilities of different healthcare professionals.'
  ]}
  correctExplanation="The most appropriate action is to seek advice from a senior member of your own team who is also responsible for the patient (Option E). The next most appropriate action would be to contact the on-call microbiologist (Option A). Looking in the BNF and prescribing what is suggested (Option B) is less preferable as the BNF does not take into account local policy. Consulting with the nurse in charge on the ward (Option D) is less appropriate as it is not suitable to prescribe any medication purely on their advice without consulting further. The least appropriate action is to refer to national guidance for pre-operative protocols (Option C) without considering the local circumstances."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on the importance of seeking advice from your own team first. Remember that the on-call microbiologist should not be the first point of contact for routine, non-emergency queries.

**If you ranked Option B or C higher**

Consider the importance of local policies and guidelines, which may differ from national guidance or the BNF. Always aim to follow local protocols when available.

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Reflect on the roles and responsibilities of different healthcare professionals. It is not appropriate to prescribe medication purely on the advice of a nurse without further consultation.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if the surgical specialty trainee is also unsure about the pre-operative protocols?**

In this case, it could be appropriate to seek advice from the on-call microbiologist, who would likely have knowledge of the required antibiotics and local hospital policy.

**What if the on-call microbiologist is unavailable?**

You could refer to the BNF as a reliable source of clinical guidance. However, remember to verify the information with a senior medical colleague if possible.

**What if the nurse in charge insists that they know what is normally given?**

While the nurse may have valuable knowledge and experience, it is ultimately your responsibility as the prescriber to ensure the correct medication is given. Always confirm with a senior medical colleague or reliable clinical guide.

### Question 6

You are looking after Mr Kucera who has previously been treated for prostate carcinoma. Preliminary investigations are strongly suggestive of a recurrence. As you finish taking blood from a neighbouring patient, Mr Kucera leans across and says “tell me honestly, is my cancer back?”

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

<RankingQuestion
  question=""
  options={[
    {
      id: 'A',
      text: 'Explain to Mr Kucera that it is likely that his cancer has come back',
      principle: 'Domain 2: Honesty and integrity - While honesty is crucial, it is important to communicate sensitive information appropriately, considering the patient\'s emotional state and the certainty of the diagnosis.',
    },
    {
      id: 'B',
      text: 'Reassure Mr Kucera that he will be fine',
      principle: 'Domain 2: Honesty and integrity - Providing false reassurances can erode trust and cause emotional distress when the truth is eventually revealed.',
    },
    {
      id: 'C',
      text: 'Explain to Mr Kucera that you do not have all the test results, but you will speak to him as soon as you do',
      principle: 'Domain 2: Communication - It is important to keep patients informed about their care, whilst also respecting their emotions and managing expectations.',
    },
    {
      id: 'D',
      text: 'Inform Mr Kucera that you will chase up the results of his tests and ask one of your senior colleagues to discuss them with him',
      principle: 'Domain 1: Teamwork and responsibility - Recognizing and working within the limits of your competence is critical, especially when dealing with sensitive information.',
    },
    {
      id: 'E',
      text: 'Invite Mr Kucera to join you and a senior nurse in a quiet room, get a colleague to hold your ‘bleep’*, then explore his fears',
      principle: 'Domain 3: Patient partnership - Empathy and support are essential when dealing with patients’ fears and concerns, but it is also important to manage your responsibilities effectively.',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['D', 'C', 'E', 'A', 'B']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the importance of honesty and integrity in communication with patients.',
    'Think about the limits of your role and the appropriateness of delivering sensitive information.',
    'Reflect on the potential emotional impact of the different responses on Mr Kucera.',
    'Evaluate the effectiveness of each response in managing Mr Kucera’s fears and concerns.',
    'Consider the implications of delegating your responsibilities to a colleague.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Informing Mr Kucera that you will chase up the results and ask a senior colleague to discuss them (Option D) is the most appropriate response, as it respects the limits of your role and ensures that Mr Kucera will receive accurate and sensitive information. Explaining that you don't have all the test results but will speak to him as soon as you do (Option C) is also appropriate, as it keeps Mr Kucera informed. Inviting Mr Kucera to discuss his fears (Option E) is empathetic but may interfere with your other responsibilities. Preemptively telling Mr Kucera his cancer is likely back (Option A) may cause undue distress, especially without all the information. Providing false reassurances (Option B) is inappropriate and risks eroding trust."
/>

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider how premature disclosure of sensitive information could impact Mr Kucera emotionally, especially if the diagnosis is not confirmed yet. Reflect on the importance of ensuring all information is accurate and complete before sharing it with the patient.

**If you ranked Option B higher**

Reflect on the potential harm of providing false reassurances. How might it affect trust and emotional distress when the truth is eventually revealed?

**If you ranked Option E higher than D or C**

Consider the balance between providing emotional support and managing your responsibilities effectively. How might involving a senior nurse and delegating your responsibilities impact your other duties?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Mr Kucera insists on knowing whether his cancer is back?**

Maintain that you will share the results as soon as they are available and a senior colleague will discuss them with him. Reassure him that his concerns are being taken seriously and his care is a priority.

**What if Mr Kucera becomes distressed and insists on an immediate answer?**

It may be appropriate to seek immediate assistance from a senior colleague or a nurse. Remember to keep communication open, honest, and empathetic while respecting the limits of your role.

**What if you discover that the test results are actually available and they confirm the recurrence of the cancer?**

In this case, it would still be best to inform a senior colleague and allow them to discuss the results with Mr Kucera. They would be better equipped to handle the conversation and answer any questions Mr Kucera might have.
