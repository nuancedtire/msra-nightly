### Question 46

On a ward round, the specialty trainee tells you to write a drug prescription for a patient, Mrs Smith. Before prescribing the drug, you realize that this medicine is contra-indicated with Mrs Smith’s other treatments. The specialty trainee has now left the ward.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  ]}
  correctExplanation="Contacting the specialty trainee (Option E) is most appropriate as it provides immediate clarification and feedback. If this is not possible, seeking advice from another senior colleague (Option B) is a good alternative. Discussing with the ward pharmacist (Option D) shows proactivity and respect for multidisciplinary input. Declining to prescribe the drug and noting in the patient records (Option C) is less proactive and does not solve the issue. Writing up the drug without a start date (Option A) risks an error if administered before clarification and is therefore least appropriate."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider the potential risks associated with writing a prescription without a start date. How might this action lead to potential errors?

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Reflect on why declining to prescribe and noting in the patient records may not be the most effective approach. How could this action fail to resolve the problem?

**If you ranked Option D lower**

Think about the role of pharmacists in ensuring safe and effective use of medication. How can collaborating with them contribute to patient safety?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if you were unable to contact the specialty trainee or another senior colleague?**

In this situation, discussing with the ward pharmacist becomes even more important. They have extensive knowledge of medications and can provide valuable advice.

**What if the pharmacist suggested a completely different medication?**

You should still consult with a senior medical team member before prescribing a different medication. Remember that pharmacists can provide advice, but final prescribing decisions are the responsibility of the medical team.

**What if Mrs Smith was having distressing symptoms and needed immediate treatment?**

This situation adds urgency, but it doesn't change the importance of safe prescribing. You should still seek advice before prescribing a contra-indicated medication.

### Question 47

You have been working on the surgical team for four weeks. One of the nurses, Jill, has undermined your decisions several times, and has twice called you incompetent in front of patients and staff. You have mainly ignored Jill’s comments, though you did try to speak to her once about your concerns without success. More recently an FY1 colleague told you that you should not allow her to speak to you like that. You have not had feedback from any other team members to indicate that there are any problems with your performance.

<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Jill continues to undermine you even after you’ve informed your consultant?**

You should follow up with your consultant and inform them about the continuing issue. Consider involving other senior staff or the Foundation Programme Director if necessary.

**What if other FY1s also report having similar problems with Jill?**

This indicates a broader issue that needs to be addressed at a higher level. Consider discussing this with your consultant or the Foundation Programme Director.

**What if Jill confronts you after finding out that you’ve spoken to the consultant about her?**

Stay professional and explain your concerns focusing on the impact on patient care and the team. If necessary, seek support from your consultant or other senior staff.
