### Question 34

Your consultant has to attend to a patient on another ward. In her absence she asks you to liaise with the radiology department to arrange an urgent CT scan for Mrs Lewis. You request to book the test but are contacted by the radiologist a few hours later. He informs you that he has rejected your request on the basis of insufficient information.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  correctExplanation="The most effective way to resolve the issue is by asking the radiologist for more information (Option B), as this provides learning for future patient care and fosters good relations. If the issue remains unresolved, seeking help from your specialty trainee (Option C) is appropriate. It's important to keep your consultant informed (Option D), but this is less urgent than resolving the issue with the radiologist. Asking your consultant to return to the ward (Option E) should be a last resort due to the potential disruption to patient care. Sending the request to another radiologist (Option A) is inappropriate as it undermines professional relationships and may cause future problems."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider how bypassing the radiologist who rejected your request might affect your working relationship. Reflect on the importance of maintaining professionalism and resolving issues directly when appropriate.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Think about the disruption caused by asking your consultant to return to the ward. Prompt and efficient communication methods, such as phone calls or emails, are often more appropriate.

**If you ranked Option D higher than B or C**

While keeping your consultant informed is important, consider whether you can first resolve the issue directly with the radiologist or seek help from your specialty trainee.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if the radiologist is unresponsive or uncooperative?**

You may need to escalate the issue to a senior colleague or your consultant. It's important to maintain professionalism and focus on the best interests of the patient.

**What if the radiologist indicates that the request needs to be made by a senior doctor?**

Consult with your specialty trainee or consultant about the best way to proceed. It may be appropriate for them to make the request.

**What if you discover that the missing information was a mistake on your part?**

Acknowledge and learn from the error. Apologize to the radiologist and correct the mistake promptly to ensure patient care is not compromised.

### Question 35

Mr Reese has end-stage respiratory failure and needs continuous oxygen therapy. While you are taking an arterial blood gas sample, he confides in you that he knows he is dying and he really wants to die at home. He has not told anyone else about this as he thinks it will upset his family, and the nursing staff who are looking after him so well.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

    'Reflect on the importance of respecting patient autonomy.',
    'Consider the role of effective communication in reassuring patients.',
    'Consider the role of the multi-disciplinary team in formulating an effective care plan.',
    'Reflect on the importance of confidentiality in discussing patient wishes.',
    'Consider the role of the GP in managing home-based care.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Reassuring Mr Reese that his wishes will be taken into account (Option B) is the most appropriate response. It is crucial to communicate this to the MDT (Option C) to ensure cohesive care. Involving the GP (Option E) is important given that they will likely be involved in his home-based care. It's only correct to share Mr Reese's wishes with his family (Option D) if he gives his full consent. Providing inaccurate information to manipulate his decision (Option A) is inappropriate, as it disrespects patient autonomy."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on the importance of patient autonomy and why it is inappropriate to provide inaccurate information in order to influence a patient's decision.

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Consider the importance of patient confidentiality. Discussing a patient's wishes with their family without their consent is a breach of this principle. 

**If you ranked Option C or E lower**

Consider the role of the multi-disciplinary team and the GP in managing patient care, particularly in situations related to home-based care. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Mr Reese's family asks you about his wishes?**

You should explain to them that you can only share this information with Mr Reese's consent. You could encourage them to have this conversation directly with him.

**What if Mr Reese's condition worsens rapidly?**

In this case, the urgency of the situation may necessitate more immediate discussions with the MDT and the GP to try to accommodate his wishes as much as possible.

**What if Mr Reese later changes his mind and decides he wants to stay in the hospital?**

This again emphasizes the importance of patient autonomy. The care plan would need to be revised in line with Mr Reese's new wishes.

### Question 36

You and another FY1, Robert, are working together on a hospital ward and are sharing ward tasks. After a couple of weeks, it becomes clear that Robert has been taking most of the quicker and easier tasks, and has been leaving you with longer and more difficult tasks. This has allowed Robert to spend additional time collecting data for an audit that his educational supervisor has asked him to do.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

      principle: 'Domain 3: Professionalism - Seeking a peer perspective can be helpful, but may not be as effective as directly addressing the issue or consulting with senior staff.',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['A', 'B', 'E', 'D', 'C']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the importance of addressing issues directly with colleagues.',
    'Reflect on the role of senior staff in providing guidance and support.',
    'Think about the potential impact of complaining versus seeking a constructive solution.',
    'Evaluate the appropriateness of discussing the issue with a peer versus a senior.',
    'Consider the potential consequences of reporting a colleague without first attempting resolution.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Speaking directly to Robert (Option A) is the most appropriate action as it allows for immediate resolution and promotes effective teamwork. If the issue persists, discussing it with your educational supervisor (Option B) can be helpful. Discussing the situation with another FY1 colleague (Option E) might provide perspective but is less effective. Complaining to the ward consultant (Option D) without seeking a constructive solution might strain professional relationships. Reporting the issue to Robert's supervisor (Option C) without first attempting resolution lacks professionalism and could damage team dynamics."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Consider how complaining, rather than seeking a constructive solution, might affect your professional relationships. What could you do differently to promote effective communication and teamwork?

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Reflect on why you chose to report Robert without first attempting to resolve the issue directly. How might this decision impact professional relationships and team dynamics?

**If you ranked Option E higher**

While discussing with a peer can provide perspective, consider why this might be less effective than addressing the issue directly or seeking guidance from a senior.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Robert becomes defensive when you approach him about the task distribution?**

Maintain a professional and respectful demeanor. Clearly express your concerns and propose a fair distribution of tasks. If the issue persists, consider discussing it with your educational supervisor.

**What if your educational supervisor doesn't take your concerns seriously?**

If you feel your concerns are not being addressed, you may want to approach another senior colleague, such as a ward consultant, for advice. Remember to approach the conversation constructively, focusing on finding a resolution.

**What if you discover that the task distribution is a common practice on the ward?**

If this is a systematic issue, it may be appropriate to raise the concern at a higher level, such as the ward consultant, while maintaining professionalism and seeking a constructive solution.
