### Question 25

One of the FY1 doctors working in your team, Haman, had a seizure whilst at a social event that you attended a few days ago. You have known him for some time and are aware that he is on medication for epilepsy. Today another FY1 colleague, who also knows about Haman’s medical condition, tells you that she saw Haman driving to work this morning.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate).**

  correctExplanation="Advising your colleague to speak to Haman directly (Option A) allows Haman to understand the concern and take responsibility. If your colleague is unsure, advising them to seek advice from a senior colleague (Option B) ensures they are guided by experience. You could also ask Haman directly about his driving (Option C) to foster open dialogue. Reporting Haman to his consultant (Option D) is a serious step and should not be the first response. Suggesting that it is Haman’s decision to drive (Option E) downplays the potential safety risks involved, making it the least appropriate response."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Reflect on the balance between respecting a colleague's autonomy and the potential implications for patient and public safety. Consider how professional responsibilities may require intervention in personal decisions.

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Consider the potential implications of reporting a colleague's fitness to practice. Reflect on the importance of initially trying to resolve concerns through direct communication and seeking advice.

<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your colleague does not feel comfortable speaking to Haman directly?**

In this scenario, it would be appropriate for your colleague to seek advice from a senior colleague on how to handle the situation.

**What if Haman denies driving after having a seizure?**

If Haman denies the claim but there are still concerns, it may be appropriate to involve a senior colleague or consult GMC guidance on reporting fitness to practice concerns.

**What if Haman continues to drive despite your colleague's intervention?**

If Haman continues to drive, escalating the concern may be necessary to ensure patient and public safety. This could include speaking to a senior colleague or reporting the concern to his consultant.

### Question 26

You are on duty at night and see a patient, Mrs Penn. Mrs Penn has developed sudden shortness of breath and signs consistent with acute pulmonary oedema.

You are aware that the specialty trainee is currently in the Emergency Department caring for a sick patient.

### Question 27

Mr. Farmer has been a patient on the ward for six months, suffering from a tracheostomy and relying on a ventilator for breathing due to a traumatic brain injury. As you make your rounds, you notice Mr. Farmer appearing to struggle with his breathing. Both the consultant and specialty trainee are attending to a patient on the neighboring ward. This being your first week as an FY1, you have yet to handle a potentially critically unwell patient alone.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1=Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  hints={[
    'Consider the urgency and severity of the situation.',
    'Think about who is most immediately available to assist and has relevant experience.',
    'Reflect on the appropriate use of resources.',
    'Consider the importance of involving seniors at the right time.',
    'Evaluate the need for immediate intervention and the potential role of the crash team.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Assessing Mr. Farmer's status immediately is crucial (Option D), with the ward nurse being the most available and capable to assist. Discussing the symptoms with the specialty trainee (Option C) should follow to make an informed decision. Involving the physiotherapy team (Option B) can be considered for their specific knowledge of Mr. Farmer's case. Asking the consultant to return (Option E) may be necessary, but only after a proper assessment. Calling the crash team (Option A) is the least appropriate as this should be reserved for arrest or immediate emergencies."
