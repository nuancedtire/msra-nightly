Penny’s seniority does not excuse her from following basic hygiene procedures (Option C). While the Infection Control team is responsible for monitoring and enforcing hygiene procedures, all staff share the responsibility for maintaining these standards (Option D)."

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Reflect on how seniority doesn't excuse poor practice. Why might you have given more weight to Penny's experience over patient safety and potential impact on other staff?

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Consider the shared responsibility of all staff in maintaining hygiene standards. Why might you have placed more importance on the role of the Infection Control team?

**If you ranked Option B lower**

Think about the potential impact on patient trust and confidence. How does this align with your understanding of patient-centered care?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Penny continued to neglect hygiene procedures even after being addressed by you?**

Consider involving a senior staff member or reporting the issue to the Infection Control team, as patient safety is paramount.

### Question 44

You are working on a weekend and are providing cover for two other wards in addition to your usual ward. You are due to finish in 15 minutes. You are contacted by a nurse from one of the other wards, James, who asks you to speak to the relatives of Elizabeth, a patient who has recently been diagnosed with cancer. James tells you that Elizabeth has been informed of the diagnosis, but that the relatives now want to talk to a doctor to discuss the diagnosis and management plan without Elizabeth being present. You do not know Elizabeth, and the regular staff are not working on site this weekend.

**Rank in order the importance of the following considerations in the management of this situation (1= Most important; 5= Least important).**

    'Reflect on the risks of miscommunication in this setting.',
    'Think about the distress to the relatives and how it can affect patient’s health.',
    'Consider the potential conflict with James and its impact on teamwork.',
    'Reflect on the commitment required in patient care.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="The requirement for patient confidentiality (Option D) is the highest priority. Since you are not familiar with the patient, there is a significant potential for miscommunication (Option A). Alleviating distress in your patient’s relatives (Option C) is also important but secondary to patient's rights. Good working relationships with colleagues are built on complying with reasonable requests (Option B), but where such requests conflict with your duty to your patient, you must stand firm. Concern about staying late (Option E) is the least important aspect in this scenario."

<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Elizabeth directly asks you not to discuss her condition with her relatives?**

In this case, it is crucial to respect Elizabeth's request for confidentiality. Explain to the relatives that you must respect the patient's wishes, and encourage them to talk to Elizabeth directly.

**What if the relatives become confrontational when you decline to discuss without Elizabeth's permission?**

It's important to remain calm and professional. Reiterate the importance of patient confidentiality and suggest they speak directly with Elizabeth.

**What if James insists that you talk to the relatives, arguing that it's part of your job?**

Explain to James that while communication with relatives is important, it must not compromise the patient's right to confidentiality. Suggest discussing the matter with Elizabeth and asking for her consent.

### Question 45

You are just finishing a busy shift on the Acute Admissions Unit* (AAU). Your FY1 colleague who is due to replace you for the evening shift leaves a message with the nurse in charge that she will be 15 to 30 minutes late. There is only a 30 minute overlap between your timetables to handover to your colleague. You need to leave on time as you have a social engagement to attend with your partner.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1=Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

<RankingQuestion
  question=""
  options={[
    {
      id: 'A',

      text: 'Make a list of patients and outstanding investigations to give to your colleague as soon as she arrives.',
      principle: 'Domain 1: Knowledge, Skills and Performance - Providing a comprehensive handover directly to your colleague ensures important clinical information is not missed and patient care is optimised.',
    },
    {
      id: 'D',
      text: 'Ask your specialty trainee* if you can leave a list of your patients and their outstanding issues with him to give to your colleague when she arrives and then leave at the end of your shift.',
      principle: 'Domain 3: Working with Colleagues and in Teams - Delegating tasks to senior colleagues may be appropriate in ensuring effective handover and patient care, but it is your responsibility to ensure the handover takes place.',
    },
    {
      id: 'E',
      text: 'Leave a message for your partner explaining that you will be 30 minutes late.',
      principle: 'Domain 1: Put Patients First - Prioritising patient safety and continuity of care over personal commitments reflects commitment to good medical practice.',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'A']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the importance of effective handover in ensuring patient safety.',
    'Think about the potential risks of leaving patient information in unsecured/unobserved locations.',
    'Reflect on how different levels of staff can support handover processes.',
    'Consider the importance of patient confidentiality.',
    'Evaluate the balance between professional responsibility and personal commitments.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Staying an extra 30 minutes to ensure an effective handover (Option E) is the most appropriate action, demonstrating commitment to patient care. Providing information directly to your colleague (Option C) is the next best option, ensuring they receive important patient information. Asking your specialty trainee to relay the information (Option D) is another option, but less effective as it is your responsibility to ensure the handover takes place. Leaving patient information on beds (Option B) risks breaching confidentiality and it being missed by your colleague. Leaving a list in the general doctors’ office (Option A) is least effective as it may not be seen in time."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on the potential risks of leaving important patient information in an unsecured and unobserved location like a general office. How might this compromise patient care?

**If you ranked Option B higher**

Consider the importance of patient confidentiality. Leaving patient notes on their beds is a potential breach of this. How could you ensure your colleague receives important information while maintaining patient confidentiality?

**If you ranked Option D higher than C**

While delegating tasks to your specialty trainee can support the handover process, remember that it is your responsibility to ensure that the handover takes place. How could you manage this situation while also fulfilling your responsibility?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your specialty trainee is also not available to assist with the handover?**

You may need to adjust your plans and stay to handover directly to your colleague. Patient safety and continuity of care should always be prioritised.

**What if your colleague is regularly late for their shifts, affecting handover processes?**

This is a broader concern that may need to be addressed with your educational supervisor or manager. Regular delays can impact patient care and team dynamics.

**What if your social engagement is a non-negotiable commitment?**

While personal commitments are important, patient safety and continuity of care should always be prioritised. If a similar situation arises in the future, try to arrange for a more effective handover process ahead of time.
