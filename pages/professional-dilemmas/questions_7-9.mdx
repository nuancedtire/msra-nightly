### Question 7

At your morning handover/briefing you are reminded by Infection Control that all hospital staff should wear shirts with short sleeves. When wearing long sleeves, they must be rolled up and secured, particularly when having clinical interaction with patients. During your shift, you notice that your FY1 colleague always has her long sleeves down.

Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1=Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).

  correctExplanation="Speaking directly to your colleague (Option B) is the most appropriate first step, as this could potentially resolve the issue promptly and maintain a positive working relationship. If the issue remains unresolved, raising the observation with the nurse in charge of the ward (Option C) could help to enforce the policy. Discussing the situation with your specialty trainee (Option E) could provide useful advice and support. While monitoring the situation (Option D) is less appropriate as it does not immediately address the issue, it is a better option than directly reporting to Infection Control (Option A) which could potentially damage your professional relationship with your colleague and may be seen as an overreaction if other steps have not been attempted first."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher...**

Consider the potential impact on your working relationship with your colleague. Reporting concerns should be done through appropriate channels and usually as a last resort after other attempts to resolve the issue have been made. 

**If you ranked Option D higher...**

Reflect on the importance of timely action in situations that could affect patient safety. While monitoring the situation could provide more information, it may also delay necessary action.

**If you ranked Option E higher than B or C...**

While seeking advice from a specialty trainee can be helpful, it is also important to be proactive in addressing issues directly or with the help of other immediate team members.

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your FY1 colleague continues to wear her sleeves down even after you've spoken to her?**

Consider escalating the issue to the nurse in charge of the ward or your specialty trainee. It's important to ensure patient safety and adherence to hospital policies.

**What if your colleague explains that she has a medical condition that requires her to keep her sleeves down?**

In this case, a discussion with your specialty trainee or a more senior staff member may be necessary to figure out a solution that respects your colleague's needs while also adhering to Infection Control policies.

**What if you notice multiple colleagues not adhering to the short sleeves policy?**

This could indicate a broader issue that needs to be addressed at a higher level. After attempting to address the issue with your colleagues, consider raising the concern with your specialty trainee or Infection Control.

### Question 8

You recently discharged two patients from your ward with similar names, who had undergone similar procedures. Arrangements have been made for both patients to receive follow up care in the community. When checking the patient records, you realize that you mixed up their discharge letters and sent each letter to the wrong patient. This means that each patient will receive the other patient’s treatment advice.

### Question 9

You are working on a surgical ward and are on your way to check the discharge of a post-operative patient, Joan, who is due to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. You have been advised by the ward manager that Joan’s bed is needed urgently for a newly arrived patient. When you arrive at Joan’s cubicle, her daughter, Allie, tells you that her mother has been complaining about her chest and is struggling with a cough. You review the observation chart and listen to Joan’s chest, which does not indicate a problem. Allie insists that her mother has a chest infection and should not be discharged.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  correctOrder={['C', 'E', 'A', 'B', 'D']}
  hints={[
    'Consider patient safety and communication with the patient and her family.',
    'Think about the importance of seeking senior advice in situations of uncertainty.',
    'Reflect on the roles of other healthcare professionals in patient care.',
    'Evaluate the urgency of the situation and the need for good handover and communication.',
    'Consider the potential impact of your decisions on the patient and her family.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="In this situation, consulting with a senior member of your team (Option C) is the most appropriate action as it allows you to seek guidance and ensure safe patient care. Contacting the rehabilitation hospital and providing detailed notes (Option E) is also appropriate to ensure good handover and prepare the receiving team for possible investigations. Involving the ward nurse in communicating with the rehabilitation hospital (Option A) is also an appropriate step. Informing Allie to insist on a review at the rehabilitation hospital (Option B) is less appropriate as it defers responsibility without fully addressing Allie's concerns. Advising Allie of the urgent need for bed space (Option D) is least appropriate as it does not prioritize Joan's wellbeing and safety."
