### Question 31

It is 8am and you are beginning a New Year’s Day shift. A fellow FY1 colleague has called in sick for the same shift, stating that she has food poisoning. The following day you learn that your absent colleague had posted pictures on a social networking site from a New Year’s Eve party that she had attended the night before her shift.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate).**

  ]}
  correctExplanation="Asking your colleague for an explanation (Option D) is the most appropriate first step, as it directly addresses the concern and gives her the opportunity to provide context. It is also good practice to seek advice from another colleague (Option C) to gain perspective. Given the public nature of social media, suggesting that your colleague remove the photos (Option B) is also appropriate to protect her professional reputation. If these actions do not resolve the issue or if there are ongoing concerns about professionalism or patient safety, involving a senior colleague (Option E) may be necessary. Sharing the information with other colleagues on the rota (Option A) is the least appropriate action, as it may harm your colleague's reputation without addressing the issue."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider the potential harm that sharing information about colleagues without their knowledge can cause. How might this affect your working relationships and professional trust?

**If you ranked Option E higher**

While it's important to involve senior colleagues in serious concerns, it's also crucial to attempt to address issues directly with colleagues when appropriate. How might prematurely escalating the situation affect your colleague's trust in you?

**If you ranked Option B lower**

Reflect on the impact of online behaviour on professional reputation. How might public perceptions of doctors be affected by such posts?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your colleague does not provide a satisfactory explanation or shows no remorse?**

You may need to escalate this to a senior colleague, as this could indicate a pattern of unprofessional behaviour that could potentially impact patient safety.

**What if your colleague admits she was not actually sick, but felt too tired to work safely after the party?**

Reflect on the importance of fitness to work and the responsibility doctors have to ensure they are adequately rested for their shifts. This could be a teaching moment about balancing social life and professional responsibilities.

**What if your colleague claims she did get food poisoning at the party?**

Consider the importance of maintaining trust and professional relationships. If her explanation is plausible, it may be best to give her the benefit of the doubt, while still discussing the potential implications of her online posts.

### Question 32

You are working on a care of the elderly ward. Mrs Singh is dying and her family have requested a single room to provide her with some privacy. Another patient, Mr Green is currently in a single room but is well enough to be moved to the four-bed ward. All other single rooms are occupied with patients that cannot be moved. A nurse has advised Mr Green that he is to be moved out of the single room but he has refused as he says he feels uncomfortable being in a ward with other patients. Mr Green’s daughter is a medico-legal solicitor.

**Rank in order the importance of the following considerations in the management of this situation (1= Most important; 5= Least important).**

      principle: 'Domain 2: Patients, Partnership & Communication - Treat patients with dignity & respect',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['A', 'B', 'E', 'D', 'C']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the importance of patient privacy and dignity.',
    'Think about the effective use of limited resources.',
    'Reflect on the relevance of Mr Green’s personal reasons for wanting the single room.',
    'Consider the appropriateness of taking into account Mr Green’s daughter’s profession.',
    'Evaluate the significance of the fact that Mr Green had the room first.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Recognising Mrs Singh's right to privacy is the most important consideration (Option A), given her condition. The unlikelihood of another single room becoming available soon (Option B) means a decision must be made promptly. Mr Green's personal reasons for wanting the single room (Option E) are important and should be respected, but are secondary to Mrs Singh's immediate need. The fact that Mr Green had the room first (Option D) is less significant than his reasons for wanting the single room. The profession of Mr Green's daughter (Option C) should not influence patient care decisions."
/>

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider how the profession of a patient's relative should not influence decision-making in patient care. Reflect on the importance of impartiality and fairness.

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Think about the significance of who had the room first versus the immediate needs of the patients. Prompt and effective resource management is often necessary.

**If you ranked Option E lower than B or D**

While the personal preferences of patients are important, consider the urgency of Mrs Singh's situation and her immediate need for privacy.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Mr Green expresses a deeply personal reason for wanting to stay in the single room?**

It's important to consider and respect Mr Green's personal reasons. However, Mrs Singh's immediate need for privacy due to her condition would still likely take precedence.

**What if multiple single rooms become available?**

In this case, both patients could potentially be accommodated according to their preferences. This highlights the importance of effective resource management.

**What if it turns out that Mr Green is not medically fit to be moved to the ward?**

This would change the situation significantly. Medical necessity is a primary consideration and in this case, Mr Green would likely need to remain in the single room.

### Question 33

You work on a busy ward with an FY1 colleague. There are many tasks to be completed and the specialty trainee has said that you and your colleague can go home once the tasks are complete. You have nearly completed your tasks when you are called to another ward on the other side of the hospital. Your FY1 colleague suggests that you call your ward when you are finished, because there will be no need to return to the ward if all the tasks are complete. When you are finished, you telephone your ward but get no answer.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate).**

    {
      id: 'A',
      text: 'Continue to telephone your ward until someone answers.',
      principle: 'Domain 1: Clear communication - Constant attempts to communicate may delay addressing urgent tasks but ensure that a message is delivered.',

      principle: 'Domain 3: Multidisciplinary working - Delegating communication to other staff should be done cautiously and with clear instructions.',

      principle: 'Domain 1: Patient care - Returning to the ward ensures that all tasks are completed and patients are cared for.',
    },
    {
      id: 'E',
      text: 'Leave the hospital and go home.',
      principle: 'Domain 4: Patient safety - Leaving without ensuring all tasks are completed can compromise patient safety.',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['D', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'E']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the most direct and reliable forms of communication.',
    'Reflect on the importance of completing all tasks before leaving.',
    'Think about what might happen if tasks are left unfinished.',
    'Consider the potential urgency of the situation on the ward.',
    'Think about how your actions impact patient safety and care.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Returning to the ward (Option D) is the most appropriate action, as it ensures that all tasks are completed and patients are cared for. Continuing to call the ward (Option A) is less efficient but maintains efforts to communicate. Asking a nurse to contact the ward (Option B) delegates the task but may not ensure all tasks are completed. Texting your colleague (Option C) is less reliable as texts may be missed. Leaving the hospital without confirming task completion (Option E) risks compromising patient safety."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider the efficiency of repeatedly calling without success. Might there be a better way to ensure tasks are completed?

**If you ranked Option B or C higher**

Reflect on the reliability of these communication methods. How might miscommunication impact patient safety and care?

**If you ranked Option E higher than D**

Think about the potential consequences of leaving without confirming all tasks are completed. What does this mean for patient safety and care?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your FY1 colleague had already left the hospital?**

Your responsibility to patient care remains. Consider other ways to confirm task completion and communicate your departure.

**What if you had an urgent personal matter to attend to?**

While personal matters are important, patient safety and care cannot be compromised. Consider how to balance your personal needs with professional responsibilities.

**What if there was an emergency on the ward?**

This underscores the importance of returning to the ward when communication attempts fail. You may be needed to assist in the emergency.
