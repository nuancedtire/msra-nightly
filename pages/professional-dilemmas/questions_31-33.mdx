## Question 31

It is 8am and you are beginning a New Year’s Day shift. A fellow FY1 colleague has called in sick for the same shift; stating that she has food poisoning. The following day you learn that your absent colleague had posted pictures on a social networking site from a New Year’s Eve party that she had attended the night before her shift.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate).**

  ]}
  correctExplanation="Asking your colleague for an explanation (Option D) is the most appropriate initial action, allowing for open communication and respect for your colleague's perspective. It's also appropriate to seek advice from another FY1 colleague (Option C) as this can provide additional insights. Suggesting that your colleague removes the photos (Option B) can be helpful advice considering the professional implications of online behaviours. Alerting a senior colleague (Option E) should only be done if there are ongoing concerns about professional standards or patient safety. Making others on the rota aware of the photos (Option A) is the least appropriate action as it serves no purpose but to embarrass the individual."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider the potential harm to professional relationships and the individual's reputation caused by spreading potentially damaging or embarrassing information. Reflect on the importance of maintaining trust and respect among colleagues.

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Think about the role of senior colleagues in addressing concerns. Escalation should be considered when there is a potential threat to patient safety or professional standards, and when efforts to address the issue directly have not been successful.

**If you ranked Option B lower**

Reflect on the potential professional implications of online behaviours. Doctors should be aware of how their online presence could be perceived and the impact it may have on their professional reputation.

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your colleague denies attending the party or claims the pictures were from a different day?**

Maintaining an open dialogue is important. If there's evidence to suggest otherwise, and if there are ongoing concerns about professional standards or patient safety, consider discussing the situation with a senior colleague.

**What if your colleague admits to attending the party but insists she was genuinely unwell?**

Professional trust is important in a healthcare team. Unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise, it's reasonable to take your colleague at her word. Remind her of the potential professional implications of online behaviours.

**What if you notice a pattern of similar behaviour from the same colleague?**

If a pattern of unprofessional behaviour emerges, it's more likely to compromise patient safety or professional standards. In this case, discussing the situation with a senior colleague may be appropriate.

### Question 32

You are working on a care of the elderly ward. Mrs Singh is dying and her family have requested a single room to provide her with some privacy. Another patient, Mr Green is currently in a single room but is well enough to be moved to the four-bed ward. All other single rooms are occupied with patients that cannot be moved. A nurse has advised Mr Green that he is to be moved out of the single room but he has refused as he says he feels uncomfortable being in a ward with other patients. Mr Green's daughter is a medico-legal solicitor.

**Rank in order the importance of the following considerations in the management of this situation (1= Most important; 5= Least important).**

    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['A', 'B', 'E', 'D', 'C']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the impact on both patients and their right to privacy.',
    'Think about the practical implications and resource allocation.',
    'Reflect on the importance of informed decision-making and patient autonomy.',
    'Consider the potential conflict of interest situation.',
    'Evaluate the importance of maintaining accurate records.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="The dignity and privacy of a patient is always a priority, so Mrs Singh's right to privacy (Option A) is the most important consideration. The unavailability of other single rooms (Option B) is the next important consideration as it impacts resource allocation. Mr Green's personal reasons for wanting to stay in the single room (Option E) needs to be considered next. The fact that Mr Green had the room first (Option D) is important, but weighing the needs of each patient is more important. The profession of Mr Green's daughter (Option C) should have no bearing on your considerations and is the least important factor."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and not allowing external factors to influence your clinical judgement. Reflect on the impact this could have on the trust between doctors and patients.

**If you ranked Option D lower**

Why did you feel the fact that Mr Green had the room first was not as important as other considerations? Reflect on the importance of taking account of all relevant factors when making decisions.

**If you ranked Option E lower**

Consider the importance of understanding and respecting patient preferences and autonomy. How might this influence your approach to similar situations in the future?

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if Mr Green had a contagious infection?**

This would change the situation considerably, as moving Mr Green could put other patients at risk. In this case, the priority might be to find another way to accommodate Mrs Singh's need for privacy.

**What if Mrs Singh's condition improved?**

If Mrs Singh's condition improved, the urgency of moving her to a single room might decrease. However, her right to privacy would still be a significant consideration.

**What if Mr Green's daughter threatened to take legal action?**

While this could add pressure to the situation, it should not influence the clinical judgement. Patient care and safety should always be the primary concern, and decisions should be made based on the best interest of the patients, not fear of legal repercussions.

### Question 33

You work on a busy ward with an FY1 colleague. There are many tasks to be completed and the specialty trainee* has said that you and your colleague can go home once the tasks are complete. You have nearly completed your tasks when you are called to another ward on the other side of the hospital. Your FY1 colleague suggests that you call your ward when you are finished, because there will be no need to return to the ward if all the tasks are complete. When you are finished, you telephone your ward but get no answer.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1=Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

      principle: 'Domain 4: Trust and Professionalism - Abandoning duties without confirmation of task completion breaches trust and professionalism.',

  ]}
  correctOrder={['D', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'E']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the importance of clear and effective communication.',
    'Reflect on the consequences of not fulfilling your responsibilities.',
    'Think about how your actions could impact patient safety.',
    'Evaluate the urgency of the situation and need for timely action.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Returning to your ward (Option D) is the most appropriate action as it ensures that all tasks are completed and patients are safe. Continuing to telephone your ward (Option A) is the next best option, though less efficient than returning to the ward. Asking a nurse to contact your ward (Option B) ensures someone knows you are no longer available but doesn't confirm task completion. Sending a text message to your FY1 colleague (Option C) is less reliable form of communication. Leaving without confirmation (Option E) is the least appropriate as it neglects duty of care."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher than D**

Reflect on the importance of direct action over passive communication. Could there be a reason no one is answering the phone? 

**If you ranked Option B higher**

How certain are you that the nurse will successfully communicate your message? What could be the consequences of miscommunication?

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider the reliability of text message communication in a clinical setting. Could there be delays or misunderstandings?

**If you ranked Option E higher**

Reflect on the responsibilities you have towards your patients and team. What could be the potential impact of leaving without confirmation?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your FY1 colleague insists you go home?**

While it's important to consider your colleague's perspective, ultimately you have a professional responsibility to ensure all tasks are completed and patient care is not compromised.

**What if you are very tired and need to go home for rest?**

While personal wellbeing is important, patient safety should not be compromised. You should ensure all tasks are completed or safely handed over before leaving.

**What if you have urgent personal matters to attend to?**

In such situations, it would be best to discuss with your supervisor or a senior colleague to find a solution that does not compromise patient care.
