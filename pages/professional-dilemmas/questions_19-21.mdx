### Question 19

You are checking drugs chart on a general medical ward and you notice that the diabetes specialty trainee has prescribed double the dose of a tablet for a patient with diabetes. You are aware that sometimes double the dose of this tablet is given to patients. The patient is stable and the specialty trainee is due on the ward in a few hours.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  correctExplanation="Contacting the diabetes specialty trainee immediately (Option B) is the most appropriate response, as it allows for prompt clarification and resolution of the issue. If immediate contact cannot be established, consulting the pharmacist (Option D) is a good alternative to gather more information about the patient's medication regimen. Checking with the specialty trainee when he arrives (Option E) is better than making assumptions or taking unilateral action, but it delays the resolution. Changing the dose without consultation (Option C) can lead to harm and breach of trust. Assuming the dosage is correct (Option A) is the least appropriate action, as it may risk patient safety if the double dose was not intended."

<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on the potential risks of making assumptions in patient care, especially when it comes to medication dosages. How could this impact patient safety?

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider the potential harm of changing prescriptions without proper consultation. What are the ethical implications of such action?

**If you ranked Option E higher than B or D**

While waiting for the specialty trainee's arrival can eventually clarify the dosage, it may delay necessary action. Why might immediate action be beneficial in this situation?

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if the specialty trainee does not answer your call?**

Consider seeking advice from the pharmacist or a senior colleague. It's important to promptly clarify the dosage to ensure patient safety.

**What if the pharmacist is unaware of the patient's double dosage?**

You should continue to seek clarification from the specialty trainee or other senior medical team members. If the double dosage is not confirmed, it may be safer to withhold the medication until it can be verified.

**What if the patient starts showing symptoms that could be side effects of the double dosage?**

Immediate medical attention should be provided to the patient. Simultaneously, urgent clarification should be sought from the specialty trainee or a senior colleague regarding the dosage.

### Question 20

Albert, a 70 year old patient, was admitted mid-morning to the General Medical ward where you are working. Albert was recently diagnosed with a brain tumour and has come back to hospital for further tests. When he was admitted, you advised Albert and his family that an MRI scan would be arranged within a few hours. The radiology department contacts you to inform you that Albert’s scan will not be performed until tomorrow morning, as a result of urgent cases needing attention this afternoon. You inform Albert’s family of the delay and they react angrily towards you.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  ]}
  correctExplanation="Firstly, it is important to empathise with Albert's family and apologise for the delay (Option B). Then, explaining the clinical need for other patients' scans to be conducted before Albert's can help the family understand the situation (Option C). It is also crucial to clarify that the information provided earlier was accurate at the time (Option E). If these explanations do not satisfy the family, informing them about the formal complaint procedure could be the next step (Option D). Blaming the radiology department (Option A) is unprofessional and the least appropriate action."

### Question 21

You and another FY1, Katrina, are working together as part of a surgical team. The ward is very busy and you are taking a blood test from a patient.
