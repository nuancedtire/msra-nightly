### Question 28

You are working on an elderly care ward. During the ward round, your consultant asks you to request a CT scan for Mrs Roberts. You overhear the specialty trainee saying to another colleague that there is no indication that a CT scan is needed for Mrs Roberts and that it is inappropriate to request one. The consultant does not hear the specialty trainee’s comments.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1=Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

  correctExplanation="Discussing with your consultant the reasons for the CT scan (Option C) is the most appropriate action as it promotes understanding and allows for accurate completion of the request form. Suggesting to the specialty trainee to raise his concerns with the consultant (Option E) promotes open communication and conflict resolution. If these discussions are not possible, it is appropriate to follow the consultant's advice (Option A). Discussing the case with the radiologist (Option B) can be beneficial but it's better to understand differing opinions within your own team first. Telling your consultant about the specialty trainee's comments (Option D) may stir up conflict and gives the appearance of tale-telling, making it the least appropriate option."

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Consider the importance of understanding the rationale behind clinical decisions to improve your learning and ensure better patient care. Reflect on the need to address conflicts within the team directly.

**If you ranked Option B higher**

While discussing with other healthcare professionals can be beneficial, think about the need to first understand and address differing opinions within your own team.

<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if your consultant is unavailable for the discussion?**

You may consider discussing your concerns with another senior colleague or the radiologist. However, ensure you are respecting the hierarchy and consider the potential impact on team dynamics.

### Question 29

During a consultant ward round, you see a patient who needs to undergo a minor operation. The consultant asks the specialty trainee to obtain consent, which he does. Later the nurse tells you that she is concerned because the patient does not seem to understand fully what is happening to him, although he is aware he is going to theatre.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1= Most appropriate; 5= Least appropriate).**

    'Consider the importance of patient understanding for informed consent.',
    'Think about who has the responsibility to ensure consent is properly obtained.',
    'Reflect on the appropriate way to deal with concerns about patient understanding.',
    'Consider the impact of advising the patient to withdraw consent.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="First, you should assess the patient's understanding of the operation (Option A) to ensure informed consent. If there are still concerns, inform the specialty trainee (Option E) so they can provide further clarification. If the issue persists, inform your consultant (Option D). Asking the nurse to contact the specialty trainee (Option C) isn't the most appropriate course of action, as it's your responsibility to handle this concern. It would be inappropriate to advise the patient to withdraw consent (Option B) without first attempting to address the misunderstanding."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option B higher**

Reflect on the implications of advising a patient to withdraw consent without first attempting to address the misunderstanding. How could this impact the patient's trust in the healthcare team and his treatment plan?

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Consider the responsibility you have as a doctor to address concerns directly, rather than delegating to the nurse. How could this affect the nurse's workload and the team dynamic?

**If you ranked Option D higher than A or E**

While it's important to inform the consultant of any concerns, consider the value of first attempting to address the misunderstanding directly with the patient or specialty trainee.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if the specialty trainee insists that they explained everything clearly to the patient?**

You could suggest that the trainee re-explain the operation to the patient in simpler terms, or ask a senior colleague for advice. It's crucial that the patient fully understands the operation for informed consent.

**What if the patient is hesitant to ask questions about the operation?**

Encourage the patient to voice any concerns or questions they may have. Explain that it's important for them to fully understand the operation, and reassure them that it's okay to ask questions.

**What if the patient doesn't speak English well, and this is causing the misunderstanding?**

Consider arranging for a professional interpreter or using translation services to ensure the patient fully understands the operation.

### Question 30

A locum senior doctor* has requested for you to prescribe a drug for a patient, Mr Singh. You've noticed in Mr Singh's charts that he is allergic to a similar drug and you're concerned that a reaction may occur if you prescribe the suggested drug. The locum doctor isn't familiar with the patients on the ward and recently reacted angrily when another FY1 on the ward questioned one of his decisions.

**Rank in order the appropriateness of the following actions in response to this situation (1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate).**

      text: 'Speak about your concerns with the nurse who would administer the drug to Mr Singh',
      principle: 'Domain 3: Colleagues, Culture & Safety - Collaborating with other healthcare professionals to safeguard patient safety.',
    },
  ]}
  correctOrder={['B', 'A', 'E', 'C', 'D']}
  hints={[
    'Consider the importance of prioritizing patient safety.',
    'Reflect on the roles and responsibilities of various healthcare professionals.',
    'Remember to communicate effectively and transparently with colleagues.',
    'Think about seeking advice when necessary.',
  ]}
  correctExplanation="Explaining your concerns to the locum doctor (Option B) is the most appropriate as it directly addresses the issue. If further advice is needed, the on-call pharmacist (Option A) is a suitable independent source. Informing the nurse (Option E) could help as they also bear responsibility for administering the drug. Consulting another senior doctor (Option C) introduces another opinion but is still appropriate. Prescribing the drug despite your concerns (Option D) is the least appropriate as it risks patient safety."

<details>
<summary>Reflections</summary>

**If you ranked Option A higher**

Reflect on why you felt more comfortable seeking advice from the pharmacist first. Consider the importance of directly communicating your concerns to the locum doctor first.

**If you ranked Option D higher**

Consider why you felt compelled to follow the locum doctor's instructions despite your reservations. Reflect on the potential impact on Mr Singh's health and the importance of advocating for patient safety.

**If you ranked Option C higher**

Reflect on why you felt the need to consult another senior doctor. While seeking advice is important, consider why directly addressing the issue with the locum doctor or seeking advice from the pharmacist might be more appropriate.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What If Scenarios</summary>

**What if the locum doctor reacts angrily when you express your concerns?**

Maintain professionalism and reiterate your concerns about patient safety. If the situation doesn't resolve, consider seeking advice from another senior doctor or the pharmacist.

**What if the pharmacist confirms that the prescribed drug could cause a reaction in Mr Singh?**

This validates your concerns. Inform the locum doctor and the nurse who would administer the drug. Do not prescribe the drug.

**What if the nurse isn't aware of Mr Singh's potential allergy?**

This highlights a potential communication gap. Ensure all relevant medical information is shared appropriately among the healthcare team to safeguard patient safety.
